<h2>Chapter I. <br> The “Final”</h2>

<p>The Final for the Hospital Cup was
being fought out between Guys and Barts,
and the usual crowd of joyful medicos were
making their way to the ground, dressed in every
fantastic garb, ringing bells and waving hideous
ear-splitting rattles. The crowd watched good
humouredly, as here a coster’s cart passed with
donkey and “Bill” and “Liza,” here the
ex-Kaiser with carrots behind his ears, and Joan of
Arc and Humpty-Dumpty, and clowns with
balloons and Dilly and Dally, and the rest. The
police had seen it all before, and shepherded them
along with firmness and good temper.</p>

<p>The ground was in a state of pandemonium till
the whistle blew, when silence fell on the
spectators, as the teams got down to serious work.</p>

<p>Each was well balanced, but contained
particular stars, the darlings of their supporters;
here was Histon the international wing “three,”
who had scored the only try for England in that
great tussle with Ireland, and Blackett the
Scottish forward whose name was terror.</p>

<p>Not least among them was Sefton, now in his
last year, who was in the running for his
International Cap, on the left wing, a deadly straight
runner, who might easily win the match if
properly fed by his centre. And so they ran through
the names, and weighed the chances, while thirty
young Britons in the pride of perfect fitness
strove for the mastery, as many of them had
fought in the Great War, with a single purpose,
to win or perish as became them.</p>

<p>Half time came with no score, and the rattles
clattered like machine guns, and the hooters
hooted, and drums beat.</p>

<p>Then the struggle became fierce and
desperate. Time after time the grand Barts pack went
through with a rush, only to be stopped by the
intrepid Jacks, at full back, who hurled himself
on the ball regardless of life and limb, or so it
seemed to the more tender of the crowd.</p>

<p>Time and again a passing movement on the
old Welch lines, en echelon, with perfect timing
nearly let the Guys’ “threes” in, but still the
lines were uncrossed. Histon had tried his
dangerous drops, and all but won between the posts,
and Sefton with his marvellous pace had run
right through, to be tackled magnificently by
Barron the full back, and so the tide had veered
amidst the wildest excitement on the part of the
spectators.</p>

<p>Time was running out, and many a looker-on
glanced at his watch expecting a replay, when
Guys’ scrum half “sold the dummy,” and cross
kicked. Sefton’s inside took it superbly, and
ran straight. There was one chance, and young
Sefton took it, crossing inside, he took a pass at
full speed, and raced in between the posts, in a
scene of wild shouting and every noise that could
be made.</p>

<p>The match was over, and Sefton was carried
shoulder high to the Pavilion, in a never to be
forgotten moment of triumph.</p>

<p>A glorious sense of exhilaration filled him. This
was a fitting ending to his career, he hoped later
to get his degree, but what was that compared
to having won the cup.</p>

<p>In the dressing room his hand was nearly
wrung off, as he got rid of the mud of the match.</p>

<p>His one regret was that his sister Ena, who
had promised to come to the match, had not put
in an appearance, and the thought of this
disturbed him in an unaccountable manner.</p>

<p>As he came from the dressing room, one of the
doctors met him, with a grave face, which gave
him a sense of impending disaster, and drew him
into a small side room.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say, Sefton, I have some very
bad news for you. This telegram came during
the match, and we did not like to give it to you
then. I opened it in case I could answer it for
you.”</p>

<p>The words were terrible enough when Sefton
read them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Come at once Father dying. Ena.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the silence of the room, the shouting and
cheering outside could be heard, and a great
feeling of bitterness came over Sefton at the contrast
between the happy throng outside, and his own
misery. He wanted to run out and tell them to
stop. It was unseemly to cheer when his father
was dying. Then he turned on the doctor angrily.</p>

<p>“Why did you not give me this at once? I
suppose you thought I would leave the ground.
Now I may get there too late.”</p>

<p>The doctor laid his hand on his shoulder
kindly.</p>

<p>“No my boy, but there was only ten minutes
to go, and knowing how keen you were on the
match, we thought you would rather we kept it
for that short time.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, the news has upset me. Of
course if I had got it then we should not have
won, it was selfish of me.”</p>

<p>“I have a taxi here all ready for you,” said
the doctor, and he led Sefton out by the back
way, and put him inside.</p>

<p>“I will tell the others,” he said.</p>

<p>The misery of the journey Sefton never
forgot.</p>

<p>He knew his father had been in failing health
for some time, but had not expected any sudden
failure.</p>

<p>Sefton’s Mother was dead, and his young
sister had only left school the summer before to
look after the house.</p>

<p>It was an ugly bleak house in Finchley that the
doctor occupied, too big and poorly furnished,
for he had never made a success of his practice,
being far too much occupied with research.
When his wife had been in full health, he had
taken in one or two patients who were on the
borderline of insanity, and treated them himself,
but his wife’s breakdown in health put a stop to
this source of income, and if she had known it,
of brilliant discovery.</p>

<p>When Sefton arrived, and had got rid of the
taxi, he was met by Ena, on whose face were
marks of tears.</p>

<p>“Oh I am so glad you’ve come, father had been
asking for you, the doctor has just left but is
coming back.”</p>

<p>“How is father?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Bad, very bad I am afraid. He had a heart
attack, quite suddenly, after lunch, and I thought
he had died, but he rallied. Of course, I could
not leave him, and wired for you.”</p>

<p>Jack Sefton went straight in to his father.
There had never been much love lost between
these two, for the doctor had been engrossed in
some research work, and did not seem to
understand his son, or take any interest in his career
except to urge him on to get qualified. Perhaps
he knew his own days were numbered.</p>

<p>He was propped up with pillows and looked
ghastly, with a blue tinge about his face.</p>

<p>“I can’t talk much, Jack,” he said slowly “and
I know the next attack will be the end, but I
must have a word with you alone. I am afraid
I have some bad news to tell you, the fact is I
have neglected my business so much lately that
the practice has gone to pieces. And I have been
so careless in collecting accounts that I have had
to dip into the little sum I had stored away for
you and Ena. I am afraid there is little left.”
He sighed.</p>

<p>A feeling of bitterness came to Jack. “Do
you mean that we shall be penniless,” then he
realised what this meant “that I shall have to
leave the hospital without qualifying.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid so, my boy, unless you can
borrow …”</p>

<p>“Borrow, who could I borrow from? Why
could you not have told me before?”</p>

<p>“I was afraid to, and I had hoped to have
made some money.”</p>

<p>Jack turned away with a movement of
impatience.</p>

<p>“Don’t be angry with me now, Jack. I shall
not be here much longer, and I have tried my
best. And I have something I must tell you
before I go, come here. It is less strain for me to
whisper.”</p>

<p>The doctor spoke earnestly, and Jack bent
over him while he told what had to be said. At
intervals, Jack gave him teaspoonfuls of brandy,
for he was weakening. When he had finished he
lay back and closed his eyes. “Better fetch
Ena,” he said in a tired voice. Jack went out
quickly and summoned the girl who came in
dry-eyed and anxious. Jack telephoned in haste for
the doctor, but before he arrived the end had
come, and Jack and his sister were left to face
the world alone.</p>

<p>The days that followed were full of
wretchedness for the young people. There was the
funeral, and the settling up, when Jack found that
things were worse than even his father had
thought. The house was only rented and this
was behind, and there were debts to be met, even
Ena’s last school bill being still unpaid.</p>

<p>Then he went to see the Hospital authorities,
who were very kind as far as sympathy went, but
adamant with regard to the future. Fees were
owing already, and it would be impossible for
him to go on for the next two terms to complete,
unless payments were made. They were very
sorry but the rules were strict. Perhaps he could
find work, and later come back and complete his
course, and so on.</p>

<p>Jack came away in utter dejection, to the
house from which most of the furniture had been
removed, and which they had to vacate the next
day with nowhere to go.</p>

<p>The one bright star was Ena, who faced the
situation with splendid bravery, and refused to
despair.</p>

<p>When Jack came in, she met him with a cheery
smile, and listened to his story with sympathetic
interest.</p>

<p>“You poor boy,” she said, “you must feel it
very much, but perhaps some day in the near
future, things may get better, and you will be able
to get qualified.”</p>

<p>Jack felt ashamed of his despair in face of her
pluck.</p>

<p>“I have tried everything, but apart from
becoming a professional in the Northern Union, if
I was good enough, I can’t see any hope. How
do we stand?”</p>

<p>She knew what he meant, as she it was who
had gone through the accounts, and settled the
bills, as soon as the lawyers had done their part
and taken their heavy toll.</p>

<p>“We shan’t have much, dear, about fifty
pounds I reckon, perhaps a little more, couldn’t
you possibly manage on that?”</p>

<p>“Impossible, and you have to live as well,
remember,” and he smiled at her. “No, there is
only one thing. If I can get away to some quiet
place, I may be able to do something, there is
just a chance. Father told me a secret before he
died, and there may be something in it, or it may
be that his brain was weakening, and that he was
imagining things.”</p>

<p>She looked at him questioningly, but
understood he did not wish to say anything further.</p>

<p>And then the post brought a letter from a
school friend of Ena’s, one of the few with whom
she had kept in contact. It was to say that
her parents had a summer bungalow at Portham-on-Sea,
which they did not use in the winter, and
that if the Seftons cared to make use of it they
were quite welcome. The key was with the agent,
and so on.</p>

<p>“There,” said Ena gaily, “I told you
something would turn up.”</p>

<p>“Where is this Portham, I’ve never heard of
it?”</p>

<p>“It’s on the South Coast, my friend has often
told me of it, shall we go there?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, we haven’t much choice, but I
should imagine it’s pretty bad this weather. We
can’t stay here, so had better try.”</p>

<p>“Oh! let’s get away from here,” said Ena, in a
voice which showed how the strain was telling on
her.</p>

<p>Jack came round and put his arm round her.
“Poor old girl, you have had a wretched time,
and all the worry has come on you; let’s get out
of it.”</p>

<p>There was little to pack, and the same
afternoon saw them on their way to Portham
Junction, and as the dreary bungalow town opened
before them, hideous and forbidding, their hearts
sank within them. Even Ena’s spirits were
damped, and she clung to Jack for a moment.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, I don’t know why,” she said, “but
I feel as though we were going into a black
tunnel, ever so deep and long.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, dear,” he said to reassure her
“as long as there’s an opening the other end.”</p>

<p>So Fate plays havoc with our lives.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch102">

<h2>Chapter II. <br> The Coming of the Stranger</h2>

<p>Ena Sefton was returning from the local
grocer, who carried on a desperate, and
fortuitous existence during the winter months,
hoping to reap a harvest in the summer. The place
now was derelict, like a show when the season has
finished, and the few inhabitants wandered round
like the survivors of a plague.</p>

<p>Some of the bungalows had wooden shutters
nailed over the windows to save the glass, and
looked like houses of the dead. Others showed
through the uncurtained windows dim
suggestions of deck chairs, and furniture covered with
sheets. Pebbles and sand covered the verandas,
and pools of discoloured water stood in the
rutted road.</p>

<p>There was no symmetry or order about the
bungalows; some more pretentious than others,
showed marks of distinction, such as a ship in full
sail over the roof, as a wind-vane, or a
conservatory where languid flowers and shrubs waited for
the spring. These were the aristocrats of
Bungalow Town. Nestling between two such, would
come a chubby democrat, quite unashamed of his
appearance, made of two railway carriages with
a pent roof over them, and a notice stating that
“This Desirable Bungalow” was “to be Let
Furnished.”</p>

<p>In the summer all alike would be crowded with
happy people, but now they were ruinous and
depressing.</p>

<p>Ena made her way down the road, stopping
now and then as a fierce blast struck her and a
blinding spindrift nearly choked her.</p>

<p>Progress was difficult against the wind bitter
with salt and driven sand, carrying a heavy
shopping basket. The stranger almost collided with
her, and drew on one side with apologies. He
glanced at the girl, and then politely asked if he
might carry the basket, and with quiet insistence
took it from her.</p>

<p>“The storm is very bad just here between the
bungalows,” he said. “I will come with you for
a little way if I may.”</p>

<p>With his cultured tone there was a note of
determination, and Ena was glad of his help,
besides being amused at his presumption. He
walked beside her regardless of the pools of
water, sheltering her from the worst of the storm,
till they came to her bungalow, which was all
dark and forbidding.</p>

<p>“This is where we live,” she said “but my
brother is evidently not back yet; won’t you come
in and wait for the rest of the storm to blow
over, he cannot be long.”</p>

<p>“My name is Halley,” said the man, bowing
slightly. “I am staying here for a short time,
but I think I had better get back; I shall have
the wind behind me, you see.”</p>

<p>Ena glanced at him, and noticed in the dim
light that he was tall and fragile-looking.</p>

<p>“Are you afraid of coming in?” she asked with
a mocking laugh, “or is it merely a question of
convention?”</p>

<p>“Neither, Miss …” he began.</p>

<p>“Sefton is my name … Ena Sefton, and
my brother’s name is Jack.”</p>

<p>Her manner was refreshing and he judged her
very young.</p>

<p>“I will certainly do so if you ask me in that
way, but an invitation in these circumstances is
often a matter of form, to be refused like a
dinner invitation when one knows there is nothing
to eat.”</p>

<p>They both laughed, and Ena opened the door.
Her life was so lonely that she was rather
enjoying the chance of talking to one who was
evidently a gentleman.</p>

<p>He carried the basket in for her, helped her
light a lamp, and an oil stove, which had gone out
and had been smoking horribly.</p>

<p>“My brother will be back soon, and you must
let me make you a cup of tea. You see there is
something to eat from the weight of the basket.”
He saw a merry smile come to her mouth, and a
pair of trusting blue eyes looked into his.</p>

<p>Soon they were sitting over the oil stove, now
giving out a welcome heat, and had started to
thaw.</p>

<p>“I wonder where Jack can have got to?” she
said. “He went out for a walk some time ago.”</p>

<p>Halley thought to himself “And left you to
carry the supplies,” but he left the remark
unsaid.</p>

<p>“He has taken lately to these long walks, and
I find it rather lonely. I would like you to see
him.”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted,” answered Halley,
amused at her naïve manner. “I am a stranger
here, perhaps the air will do me good.”</p>

<p>She glanced at him, and thought he looked ill,
though straight and very handsome. She
imagined he had suffered in health or through some
secret sorrow, and her girlish fancy was already
building a romantic past round him.</p>

<p>The silence was becoming awkward. Outside
the rain was streaming from the roof, and the
wind moaned with sullen fury.</p>

<p>“How do you like this place?” she asked, to
say something.</p>

<p>“It is quiet, and suits me, but …”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>He glanced at her. “Well, this horrible
murder at the castle has rather upset things.”</p>

<p>She gave a nervous shudder. “It has upset us
all. I get quite frightened, my brother is out so
much, and I sit here and listen to the wind, and
imagine all sorts of things.”</p>

<p>“You poor girl!” he said so gently that it took
all the familiarity from the remark.</p>

<p>“The villagers, what there are of them, declare
there is a curse on the Reckaviles,” she said and
shivered.</p>

<p>“You don’t believe that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I went and looked at the
castle—it’s a dreary place, and one can picture
anything happening there.”</p>

<p>He glanced at her anxiously, this morbid
conversation must stop before he went: he heartily
cursed the brother for leaving this sweet little
creature alone.</p>

<p>“May I smoke?” he asked to change the talk.</p>

<p>“Why, certainly,” she said, and bit her tongue
with vexation as she realised she had nothing to
offer, but Halley produced his case.</p>

<p>“You don’t?” he asked offering it to her.</p>

<p>“No, that’s not one of my vices,” she laughed.</p>

<p>“Do you know I am so glad; I suppose I am
old-fashioned, but I can never get used to girls
smoking, especially young girls.”</p>

<p>“I’m twenty-one,” she said bridling.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Miss Sefton, I was not
thinking of any special case.”</p>

<p>She did not know whether to be annoyed or
not, so changed the conversation.</p>

<p>“The wireless set is our only amusement, but
I am afraid it is out of order.”</p>

<p>He walked across and examined it.</p>

<p>“It is a very good set, but there is something
wrong. May I have an examination?”</p>

<p>“It is not ours you know; it belongs to the
house, we only have the use of it while we are
here.”</p>

<p>She watched him under the lamplight, his keen
alert face and deft fingers suggested the artist.
He fixed the ear phones to his head and began
juggling with screws and wires in skillful
manner. Ena watched him with the fascination a
novice always feels for the expert, till the
boiling kettle drew her to her duties with the teapot.</p>

<p>Halley removed the ear phones, and switched
on the loud speaker, when a faint sound of music
came forth.</p>

<p>“There is something wrong,” he said, “but I
think I can put it right for you, if you will allow
me to come again.”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly, but come and have a cup of
tea now.”</p>

<p>They were soon sitting like old friends over
the oil stove, discussing the place, and again she
resorted to the gruesome crime which had fallen
on the village—the murder of Lord Reckavile in
his castle. Seeing that she was bent on
discussing it he let her have her way.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see him?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p>“No, you know he very seldom came here. He
had only been back from abroad quite a short
time. It is altogether a mystery, but you know
they say there is a curse on the family. No one
will go near the castle now, even in the daytime,
and you could not get anyone in the village to
go there at night for any sum of money.”</p>

<p>“He was stabbed, wasn’t he? I read the bare
account of the inquest.”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the back, and there was no one in the
room,” she glanced uneasily round the lounge,
and listened to the breaking of the waves and the
wash of the sea outside.</p>

<p>His anger rose against her brother for leaving
her alone, and though he knew he had no right
to presume on her invitation, he stayed on as long
as he possibly could.</p>

<p>At last he rose.</p>

<p>“I must really go,” he said. “I will come round
and put your set right, and perhaps I can see
your brother then.”</p>

<p>“Thank you so much. It has been so good of
you to keep me company,” and there was a
wistful look in her eyes.</p>

<p>She came with him to the door, and as he
opened it a blast of the storm struck them,
making the lamp flare up. Halley reeled against the
door-post with a quick gasp of pain.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Nothing, just a touch of giddiness, an old
wound which troubles me sometimes.”</p>

<p>She watched him down the rough road,
bending with the fierce gale, and came in with a sigh.</p>

<p>Halley was as good as his word. He came the
next evening with a parcel under his arm. All
day Ena had been looking forward with pleasure
to seeing him. She had told Jack of the chance
meeting, which news he had received in a surly
manner.</p>

<p>“We can’t afford to entertain, you know, Ena,
and I don’t like people seeing our penury.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” she said. “I thought it would
be a man friend for you, and Mr. Halley does
not seem the kind of man who wants
entertaining as you call it.”</p>

<p>“From your description he seems a sort of
wandering artist fellow, and I hate that type. I
don’t know that I care to see him much.”</p>

<p>“But Jack, you must. He cannot come here
and find you out again, and he is coming to put
the wireless set right. You know you would like
to have it working.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is he?” said Jack. “Well, I can tell you
what is wrong with it, it wants a new high tension
battery, which costs about a sovereign, and we
can’t afford it.”</p>

<p>Ena started—she wondered if Halley had
found that out.</p>

<p>“You will come home won’t you, Jack?” she
pleaded.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Ena. I’ll try, but I can’t be
certain.”</p>

<p>There was a shifty look in his eyes which she
did not like, but he jumped up abruptly and left
her without further discussion.</p>

<p>When Halley came the storm had gone, and
the moon was shining on the water. He had
quite a boyish appearance and came in with a
cheerful smile. Ena greeted him with pleasure,
but felt a sense of shame at Jack’s absence again.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to call so late, Miss Sefton,” he
said “but I have been away all day, and I thought
there was more chance of seeing your brother—besides
it will be better for the wireless.”</p>

<p>“Jack promised to be in,” she said doubtfully.
“He should have been here before now.”</p>

<p>He placed his parcel on the little table, and
undid the wrapper, and she saw with misgiving
what was inside.</p>

<p>“You have not got a new battery?” she asked,
and her colour rose.</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought perhaps that was the trouble,”
and he proceeded to fix it.</p>

<p>She was annoyed. It was taking a mean
advantage of their poverty and she resented it, but
what could she say? Offer to pay for it? That
would be an insult again. She feared what Jack
would say knowing how sensitive he was on this
point.</p>

<p>“You should not have done that,” she said
weakly.</p>

<p>“It is nothing, Miss Sefton. It is too good a
set to be idle.”</p>

<p>But there was a feeling of restraint between
them which he noticed. The adjustment made,
he turned on the switch, and tuned in. A burst
of music filled the room, and conversation was
unnecessary.</p>

<p>The evening was delightful, and he stayed
on giving her the best from the different
programmes. At nine-thirty came the news
bulletin, and weather forecast, and after that an
announcement. She caught the words “Portham
Junction” and heard Mr. Halley give a quick
intake of breath.</p>

<p>Then came the stony words. “I will repeat.”
“Missing from Home, Frederic Summers, Bank
Manager from Tunbridge Wells, since January
20th. Aged 40. Tall, clean-shaven, dark. Last
seen at Portham Junction carrying a hand-bag.
He had gone on a week’s holiday, and his friends
have heard no news of him since that date.” And
then followed the usual request for information.</p>

<p>Ena looked up, and their eyes met.</p>

<p>“It appears to be one of those mysterious
disappearances which baffle the police,” he said in
level tones.</p>

<p>“But it’s so near to this place, and coming
after the—other thing,” she said and stopped.</p>

<p>“There’s no need for alarm,” said he “it may
be a simple case of loss of memory, or some
natural explanation.”</p>

<p>“Of course, but this place is so lonely, and
Jack is out so much.”</p>

<p>“You must tell him, and ask him to come in
earlier, but forgive me, I have no right to talk
like that.” He spread out his hands in apology,
and she for a moment was reminded of something
not quite English. There was just a touch of
the alien, not menial, but rather belonging to the
Age of Chivalry, which lives on in remote places.</p>

<p>“We must arrange a definite meeting,” he
said. “You see, although this place is small, and
quite unconventional, I cannot come here to see
you. You understand that.”</p>

<p>“Of course, you are right. I will tell him when
he comes in.”</p>

<h2>Chapter III. <br> The End of the Line</h2>

<p>“I want you to go to Portham-on-Sea, to
take up the Reckavile murder, Fletcher,”
said Chief Inspector Sinclair.</p>

<p>Fletcher was a youngster in the Service, with
quick restless eyes, and an alert face; it was a
great opportunity for him.</p>

<p>“I thought they would have to call us in, sir,”
he said with a smile.</p>

<p>“It’s about time, too,” growled the older man
“there’s the deuce of a fuss over the affair, not
that the man was worth much, but he was a peer
of the Realm, and a member of the House of
Lords, though I don’t suppose he ever saw the
inside of the building.”</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps you …” began
Fletcher.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got too much on hand already,”
interrupted the other. “Besides it will give you a
chance, and I know you younger men think I am
getting too old for the work.”</p>

<p>There was a grim smile on the face of the old
detective, as he noticed a guilty blush which
Fletcher tried to hide.</p>

<p>“Well, just sit down and I will give you the
main facts as they are known, though you have
probably read the newspaper accounts.”</p>

<p>Fletcher nodded.</p>

<p>“Portham itself is a tiny fishing village, and
the nearest station is Portham Junction, about
two miles off. In the last few years there has
grown up a bungalow town, about five miles to
the west along the coast. This has been called
Portham-on-Sea. Between these two is a wooded
headland, and in these woods is situated
Reckavile Castle. You will be able to see all this on
the spot.</p>

<p>“Now for the crime. On January 14th last,
Reckavile returned from one of his periodical
journeys abroad. There is no one living at the
castle except an old servant, Giles, and his wife,
and most of it is permanently shut up. The
whole place has run to seed, and there is only a
track to the lodge where a gamekeeper of sorts,
named Stevens, lives alone.</p>

<p>“On 20th January, at about 7 p. m. the
village constable, John Brown, called to see Lord
Reckavile about some alleged poachers, who had
been hanging about the woods. He thought
them poachers at the time, but in view of what
has occurred, they may have had more sinister
intentions. I suppose Giles and Brown stopped
gossiping, and probably drinking the Reckavile
beer, and then the servant went to tell his master.</p>

<p>“You must follow this carefully now. He
came running back to Brown, saying he could
get no answer, and that something was wrong as
he heard sounds of quarrelling, though he had
admitted no one to the house. He was white and
trembling, and very agitated. He almost
dragged the constable along, and when they
reached the library door, they could distinctly
hear two people talking. There were two doors,
an outer one of oak, and an inner one of green
baize. The constable has been thoroughly
examined, though he is not very intelligent, I am
afraid. He says they distinctly heard Reckavile
say ‘Never, never, only over my dead body!’
The other replied ‘I only want justice and my
right.’ They seemed to be angry. There was a
confused noise, a sound of a blow, a horrible cry,
and then silence.</p>

<p>“They waited a moment and knocked, but
there was no answer; there was a heavy oak chair
in the hall, and with this they battered down the
door. The room was in a state of wild confusion—I
use the constable’s words—the furniture
overturned, and splashes of blood on the floor
and chairs.</p>

<p>“Lord Reckavile was lying across the sofa,
face downwards, and an ugly knife was sticking
in his ribs. The room was empty, and Brown
stayed there while Giles went for help. There
is no doctor nearer than five miles off, so the
gamekeeper rode off to the village to telephone
for the doctor and the police at Ashstead, the
nearest town.</p>

<p>“Outside the house, Giles met a certain Mr.
Sefton, who was out for a walk. While he was
not a qualified doctor, I believe he was a medical
student, and Giles thought he might be of some
service, so brought him in. He was able to
pronounce the man dead—without a doubt.</p>

<p>“That is all. Here are the papers containing
the account of the inquest, and of our confidential
examinations. The best thing for you to do is to
get on to the spot.”</p>

<p>Fletcher had produced a large pocket book,
and taken notes. He now turned to them and
read them through.</p>

<p>“May I ask a question or two, sir?” he said.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Sinclair “I should like you
to do so, it will show what you are made of.”</p>

<p>“You say there was no one in the room. Is
that absolutely certain?”</p>

<p>“The constable, as I told you, is rather a stupid
person, but he never left the room after they
burst open the door, and it was only a few
minutes after that Giles returned with Sefton.”</p>

<p>“What about means of exit?” said Fletcher
scanning his notes.</p>

<p>“A thorough search was made, first by the
constable and the others, and afterwards by
Sergeant Andrews from Ashstead. The windows
were securely fastened, and there was no other
door, and no trap doors or secret panels that can
be found.”</p>

<p>“The door was locked, where was the key?”
asked Fletcher again.</p>

<p>His Chief gave a chuckle. “Good!” he said,
“there was no key found.”</p>

<p>“One last question, sir. What was the
weapon?”</p>

<p>“An old dagger, with a thin blade. The
waistcoat had been torn back, and the blade driven in
between the ribs from the back, and had
penetrated the heart. It had been cleverly done and
seemed to show a knowledge of anatomy, but we
must not jump to conclusions.”</p>

<p>“This is a tough nut, sir.”</p>

<p>“It is,” said the other grimly. “But before
you go, I want to tell you something of the
Reckaviles. It will save you hunting it up. They are
a queer lot. This one was the last of his line, and
people who know, say it is a very good thing.
The Reckaviles always said there was a curse
on them, set there by an old witch or something
of that sort, but less charitable folk say there was
madness in the family, and they are probably
nearer the truth.</p>

<p>“There was one in the Eighteenth Century
who had been a leader in the Medmenham orgies,
and was found stark dead in the Abbey with
no marks on him. There was another who lost
everything he had in one night’s sitting at
White’s, and left the room smiling like a fiend.
He retired to a strip of woodland on the South
Coast where Portham now stands, and built
himself a ramshackle house. It was half of rubble
and half brick, and he designed it himself, with
a complete disregard to sanitation or comfort.
There with what supplies of brandy he had saved
from the wreck of his fortunes, he drank himself
to death in a dignified way, timing his last seizure
with his final bottle and apologising to his wife
for the trouble he was giving.</p>

<p>“The father of the last Reckavile ran away
with a draper’s wife, and then challenged him
to fight for the lady. The draper applied for
police protection, and divorce, and got both.
Reckavile married the woman, and was finally
drowned when returning from abroad, and his
body was washed ashore near the castle.</p>

<p>“I gather that the family fortunes were at
about rock bottom, when a speculative builder,
who chanced that way, saw possibilities of a
bungalow town, on the foreshore, without the irk
of a town council, and interfering inspectors.
The last Reckavile found himself in funds, and
wandered abroad. I could tell you much more,
some of it such deeds as can only be hinted at,
but this will suffice.”</p>

<p>Fletcher lay back in his chair, lost in thought.</p>

<p>“What a family!” was his comment, but to
himself he said “I wonder why he has told me
all this,” and he looked at the shrewd face of the
famous detective, which remained inscrutable.</p>

<p>“And now the last of the line has come to a
tragic end,” said Sinclair musingly “so I suppose
the Curse has worked out.”</p>

<p>“Curse?” said the other startled, “you don’t
believe in the Curse, sir, do you?”</p>

<p>Sinclair looked at him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know, there are many things we
are finding out about now, which our fathers
scoffed at,” was his reply.</p>

<p>Fletcher gathered up the papers and went out
on his quest, and managed to leap into the
carriage as the train was moving, nearly falling over
a young girl who was the sole occupant of the
compartment, and hastily apologised.</p>

<p>“I hope I did not hurt you,” he said.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” she answered with a bright smile
“but I was afraid you were going to slip
between the carriage and the platform; it’s
dangerous getting into trains like that you know.”</p>

<p>He was amused at the serious fashion in which
she rebuked him. A glance at her showed him
that she had a pretty face and a smart figure,
and was neatly but plainly dressed.</p>

<p>On the floor was a letter which she had
dropped, and stooping, he picked it up, and with his
quick, trained eyes instinctively read the
name—‘Miss Ena Sefton.’ As he handed it to her,
‘Sefton … Sefton …’ he said to himself.
Where had he heard that name? Of course, the
medical student who had been called in to see
the dead Lord Reckavile. It was an uncommon
name, and the train was going to Portham
Junction. What a strange coincidence if …</p>

<p>“My name is Fletcher,” he said, for he had no
reason to conceal his identity. “I wonder if by
chance you know Portham-on-Sea.”</p>

<p>“Why certainly,” she replied “I live there at
present, with my brother. Are you going there?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said “I am staying there a few days.
It’s a sort of bungalow town, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You’ll find it terribly dull in the winter. Of
course, in the summer it’s different,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, I want to be quiet and have a rest,” he
replied. “I am sure I shall not find it dull,” and
he glanced at the girl.</p>

<p>She looked at him with innocent blue eyes.
She was evidently not the sort that takes offence
or sees an insult in a man looking at her.</p>

<p>He led the conversation round with practiced
skill to the crime, but her brows clouded over.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “it upset us terribly. It was
horrible and you know the castle itself suggests
some dreadful crime. It is so broken down and
uncared for.”</p>

<p>“I suppose they have no idea in the village as
to who the murderer could be?” he asked.</p>

<p>“All the villagers—what few there are of them
in the winter, are convinced that it had something
to do with the Reckavile Curse.”</p>

<p>“You don’t believe that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, it was all so mysterious, but my
brother laughs at it; you know he was called in
when it occurred. He is almost a qualified
doctor.”</p>

<p>“I saw something about it in the papers,” he
said evasively.</p>

<p>“I believe he saw more than the stupid
detective did. He told me nothing, but he hinted at
things once or twice.”</p>

<p>Fletcher thought he had better get off
dangerous ground for the present. His companion was
charming, and seemed to have no objection to
talking. In a short time he was possessed of all
the facts about the Seftons, and Portham-on-Sea.</p>

<p>It was a queer collection of shanties, dumped
down without plan or method; some were of
wood or corrugated iron, some old Army huts,
and others made of railway carriages. They
straggled in two irregular lines along the
foreshore, and between them was an apology for a
road.</p>

<p>By the time the train arrived at Portham
Junction Fletcher had received an invitation to
call on the Seftons. As he had arranged to meet
the local constable at the castle, he reluctantly
parted with his companion and turned his mind
to the grim problem before him.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch104">

<h2>Chapter IV. <br> At the Castle</h2>

<p>Fletcher was not one to let the ground
get weedy under his feet. Leaving his bag
at the railway station, he made his way on foot
to Reckavile Castle.</p>

<p>It was a wet afternoon, and dusk was coming
on when he got within sight of the building.
Traces of flower-beds and garden plants showed
through the tangle of growth, like the ruins of
an old civilisation, giving the place an air of
desolation. The castle was a depressing structure,
massive and dim and the wet dripped ceaselessly
from the trees. Time had covered the building
in parts with ivy, and on the rest of the walls
green patches of lichen grew like a disease.</p>

<p>The blind upper windows looked like dead
eyes, and in spite of his cheery nature, Fletcher
shuddered as a figure stepped suddenly from the
shadow without noise.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” said Fletcher in a louder tone
than he intended.</p>

<p>“Brown, sir, I suppose you are Mr. Fletcher?”</p>

<p>The latter felt a sense of relief; the constable
was a stalwart ex-guardsman.</p>

<p>“What are you doing out here in the wet?” he
asked shaking the other by the hand.</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, sir, I don’t like the place,
and I thought I would wait here; we cleared
the Giles out after the murder, and locked it
up.”</p>

<p>He produced a great key, and led the way to
the front door.</p>

<p>It was a massive portal surmounted by carved
stone work, now green and crumbling. The hall
was square and lofty, with a great open fireplace,
cheerless and empty. The last light of the dying
afternoon showed portraits on the walls, and a
staircase leading upwards.</p>

<p>“I’ll get a light,” said the constable, and
stamped off to the kitchen, returning with a lamp
which threw a bright light on the walls and
timbered ceiling.</p>

<p>“That’s better,” said Fletcher, “this place is
confoundedly damp.”</p>

<p>“There were only two rooms used by the
Giles,” said Brown, setting down the lamp, “the
kitchen and a bedroom next to it, but they always
kept Lord Reckavile’s rooms ready, as they
never knew when he was coming back. He only
used his library, and a bedroom on the ground
floor. All the rest of the house is shut up, and
full of rotting furniture.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have a look at the library then,”
Fletcher said, and the constable led the way.
Everything had been left untouched; the battered
door still hung loose, and inside the furniture had
been tossed and thrown about.</p>

<p>“There’s where the body was, lying over the
sofa, and you can see the stains of blood on the
floor and the armchair.”</p>

<p>Fletcher examined the dark marks of ill omen.</p>

<p>“Everything is just as it was. I made a
careful list,” said Brown. “There is the wireless, a
four valve set, and this is his desk, a very old one
I should say, and that cabinet contains what they
call a dictaphone, though I call it a gramaphone.
His Lordship was very keen on these things.
Here is a sketch I made, very rough I am
afraid,” and he handed it to Fletcher.</p>

<p>It was a comfortable room, in contrast with the
rest of the house; the furniture was good, and
rows of books in shelves gave it a homely look.</p>

<p>“You found no trace of anyone when you
entered?” asked Fletcher.</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt about that, sir,” was the
reply. “When old Giles and I came in there
was no sign of the murderer, and the whole place
has been searched. There are no secret passages
or trapdoors, such as one reads of in books.”</p>

<p>“Any finger prints?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, or foot marks either. Sergeant
Andrews is pretty smart at that sort of thing; he
had the dagger examined.”</p>

<p>“Someone who knew what he was about
evidently,” said Fletcher.</p>

<p>The other looked at him queerly, without a
word.</p>

<p>“Was anything else found which could throw
a light on the subject?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, we have all the exhibits here; after
the inquest I took charge of them.”</p>

<p>He went to a side table and removed a cloth.
Neatly laid out were various objects. There was
a case containing a few pound notes, some letters,
a cigarette case, and silver match box, and a
passport. There was also a well-worn, leather
object which caught the detective’s eye. It was
round, and looked as though it had been made to
hold a golf ball.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No one seems to know,” said the constable,
“it’s a puzzle.”</p>

<p>Fletcher picked up a letter case.</p>

<p>“Where did this come from?” he said.</p>

<p>“That was lying on the floor,” said Brown.</p>

<p>Inside was a faded miniature of a very
beautiful girl, and a young boy, and in faint letters
“Mother and Roy,” and a date some twenty years
before.</p>

<p>“Lord Reckavile when a child, with his
mother, I suppose,” said Brown.</p>

<p>Fletcher took it to the lamp. The boy had
sad sweet features, almost Italian.</p>

<p>“Is there a portrait of Lord Reckavile
anywhere?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, in the hall,” and Brown led the way
with the lamp.</p>

<p>Paintings of Reckaviles looked down from the
walls. Fletcher had imagination, and he could
see the latent madness in their eyes, but there was
more. They could be capable of great deeds or
great sins; he could picture a Reckavile doing a
stupendous act of heroism or a vile thing which
would blanch the cheek.</p>

<p>His thoughts were interrupted by Brown.</p>

<p>“That’s the last of them, sir,” he said pointing
to a portrait of recent date. Fletcher looked at
a handsome ascetic face, wherein was cruelty and
lust, but a pride which nothing could daunt.</p>

<p>“And who is that?” said he pointing to a stout
lady of mature charms.</p>

<p>“That was his mother, the last Lady
Reckavile, but that was before my time. She used to
live here; since her death the house has been shut
up, most of the year.”</p>

<p>Fletcher was still holding the miniature in his
hands; he looked at the portrait on the wall and
then at the other, and was about to speak, but the
bovine face of the constable stopped him.</p>

<p>Instead he said, after a pause, “About those
poachers, Brown, I understand you saw some in
the woods a few days before the murder?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I mentioned it to Stevens. I did
not see them close enough to recognise them.
There were two. Stevens told me to come up and
see Lord Reckavile about it, the very day the
murder took place.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, let’s have a look at the house,
bring the lamp.”</p>

<p>They passed into the rooms on the ground
floor, and as they opened the doors they were met
with a damp, musty smell as from a vault.
Everything was in ruin and decay and dust was
heavy over all.</p>

<p>There was a great dining room, with hanging
chandeliers, which had witnessed many a
midnight orgie, now silent and given to the moth.</p>

<p>The drawing room was bare, haunted only by
the ghosts of past Reckaviles, and so on in the
upper rooms, where gaunt fourposters and faded
hangings showed within, with dimly seen
bedroom furniture.</p>

<p>In one of these a picture fell with a crash,
waking the echoes of the house. It had been hanging
by a thread which the opening of the door had
snapped.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen enough,” said Fletcher with a
shiver. “I suppose the whole house has been
searched?”</p>

<p>“Every corner, sir, it’s all the same. It
doesn’t look as though anyone had been into the
rooms for years.”</p>

<p>They returned to the library, where Fletcher
walked to the wireless set, and turned the switch.</p>

<p>“It’s no good, sir, it’s out of order, we’ve tried
it. The valves light all right, but something’s
wrong; Giles says it hasn’t worked since Lord
Reckavile came back this last time.”</p>

<p>“I must have a look at it,” said Fletcher. “I’m
rather fond of these things.”</p>

<p>“The gramaphone works, we have tried the
records,” said Brown, “so the other ought to.”</p>

<p>Fletcher smiled at his knowledge of scientific
matters, then faced him squarely.</p>

<p>“Now, Brown, I want you to tell me fairly,
your opinion of the whole thing, because you
have been here from the beginning.”</p>

<p>A sudden change came over the constable, and
he glanced round uneasily, a look of fear in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir,” he said, “I don’t think his
Lordship was killed by any living man.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, what on earth do you mean? You
don’t believe in spooks, do you?” said Fletcher
contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s very queer, the villagers say …”</p>

<p>“Oh! I see, you’ve been talking in the village,
and heard all about the Reckavile Curse, and
that sort of thing; let’s have common sense.”</p>

<p>“We heard them talking quite plain,” the
constable replied. “Reckavile and the Other, and
when we broke in there was Lord Reckavile dead,
and It had gone.”</p>

<p>“It? Don’t talk like that, it’s foolish,” but in
spite of his words Fletcher felt a cold shiver; the
place was eerie.</p>

<p>“I don’t like it, sir, there are queer tales about,
and the Reckaviles were a very rum lot.”</p>

<p>“Enough of this,” said the other impatiently.
“I wanted clues or anything suggestive, and you
give me ghosts.”</p>

<p>But before that night was over, even Fletcher
was shaken.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch105">

<h2>Chapter V. <br> The Reckavile Horror</h2>

<p>The constable had gone. Being off duty, he
had volunteered to fetch Fletcher’s bag
from the station, while he remained as he said to
‘get the atmosphere of the place.’ A large fire
had been kindled, and the room certainly looked
more cheerful, but Fletcher wanted to damp
down the feeling of uneasiness which the
surroundings had aroused. He was sure this was
a straightforward problem, if he could only get
a clue to start with. He wandered round the
room, pausing to listen to the wind, which had
now risen to a gale. The boughs of the trees,
which had grown close to the house, were
scraping against the windows, as if trying to get in,
and all the timbers were groaning and creaking
in desire to tell him something. He shook
himself; this would never do, he would have a look
at the books as he was getting morbid.</p>

<p>Someone had said that a man can be known
by his books, but here was a catholicity of choice,
books on science, art, history, and novels. He
picked out volumes, but his mind was still on the
strange noises all over the house.</p>

<p>At last he found a leather-bound book without
title and idly opened it. To his surprise the
writing inside was in manuscript; the ink faded,
but by the spelling he judged it was not of very
ancient date.</p>

<p>It was called <i>Tales of the Reckaviles</i>.</p>

<p>As he turned the pages and read the horrors
recorded there, he first wondered that these
things could have happened, and then that
anyone should have set himself in cold blood to write
them out.</p>

<p>He came to a tale which arrested his attention.
It was called <i>How the Curse Came</i>, and was one
of the milder stories:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>A certain Sir Hugh Reckavile was a very evil knight.
  He feared neither God nor Devil. He was shunned by
  all men of good repute and consorted with vile men,
  cutthroats and worse. This knight had conceived a great
  desire for the young wife of the Lord of Glarne, though
  he had a wife and children of his own, and nothing would
  stay his purpose. As he was revelling with his companions,
  as his custom was, he took a dreadful oath that he would
  that night carry off the lady from her room in the Tower,
  and staked his soul on the venture, calling down a Curse
  on his family if he lost. His companions tried to dissuade
  him, but he would have none of their advice, and rode off.
  There was one at the table not all besotted in crime, who
  mounted and rode fast and hard, and came to the Castle
  before him, and told the Lord of Glarne.</p>

  <p>When Sir Hugh came to the Tower, he saw a fair damsel
  beckoning him from her high window, who was a maid
  dressed as the lady, and he essayed to climb the wall. They
  who had laid the trap looked to see him fall, but he came
  at the window, where men were waiting who bound him
  fast. For three days they left him there and then one
  was sent to see how he fared, returned all of a sweat, saying
  that he had heard Sir Hugh talking with One who told
  him of his damnation, and that a perpetual Curse would be
  laid on his family.</p>

  <p>That night there were howlings and dreadful crying
  heard. The next morning Sir Hugh lay on the grass,
  thrown from the window by no mortal hand, and his face
  was stamped with horror unspeakable. And so it is in life,
  for thus by the impious act of trafficking with the Devil,
  this evil man brought a Curse upon his innocent family
  which abides even to this day.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Fletcher got thus far. “Pooh!” he said, “it’s
the usual stuff one finds in these old chronicles,
still it throws a light on the Reckaviles.”</p>

<p>He dropped the book from his hand, and in
doing so happened to glance behind him.</p>

<p>The green baize door was slowly opening.</p>

<p>For a moment Fletcher sat where he was,
rigid, with every nerve on a stretch. All the
stories he had ever heard of vampires and devils
gathered round him. The next his common
sense and courage rose to his aid, and he stood
up, not without an effort, and faced round. He
clapped his hand to his pocket, but he was
unarmed.</p>

<p>For want of a better weapon he seized the
poker and waited. The door was opening in
little jerks, not smoothly; then a hand came
round the corner, a hand wrapped in a bandage,
or some white fabric, and clutched the door.
Then, very slowly, a face appeared, a vacant
dead-looking face, surrounded by a mass of white
hair streaked with yellow.</p>

<p>Without a word or sound there came into the
room, an old bent man. Fletcher waited; man
or ghost, here was no formidable antagonist.</p>

<p>Suddenly light dawned on him, and he could
almost have laughed.</p>

<p>“Why of course,” he said, “I suppose you are
Giles?”</p>

<p>The old man remained rooted to his place by
the door, and then in a high piping voice, said,
“Giles I be, and who be you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought to tell you, I am a friend
of Brown the constable, and I am waiting for
him.”</p>

<p>It was most awkward, as he had wished to
remain unknown in his true character, but the
old man looked nearly an idiot.</p>

<p>At that moment a loud knock was heard, which
came as a relief to Fletcher.</p>

<p>“That must be Brown,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and let ’ee in,” said the old man, and
turned without a sound.</p>

<p>“That’s a good thing,” thought Fletcher, “but
I must warn the constable to keep his mouth
shut.”</p>

<p>A sound of steps came along the hall, and
Brown came in, dripping wet. “Sorry to have
been so long, sir,” he said putting down the bag.</p>

<p>“I am very glad to see you,” said Fletcher,
“old Giles let you in, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Brown looked at him in surprise, “Giles? No,
the door was open, I forgot we did not fasten it.
I left Giles at Stevens’ cottage just now.”</p>

<p>“But, he’s just been here, not a minute ago, I
have been talking to him. He came to see who
was here.”</p>

<p>“Giles, sir, you must have been mistaken.
What was he like?”</p>

<p>“An old, white-haired man, with a white
beard.”</p>

<p>The constable looked blankly at him. “That’s
not Giles, sir. You must have been dreaming.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, he came in through that door not
five minutes ago.”</p>

<p>“What did you say he was like?”</p>

<p>Fletcher repeated the description minutely and
Brown’s face took on a look of horror.</p>

<p>“Oh Lord, sir! That was an old Reckavile,
the father of the one who was drowned.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Fletcher sharply, “don’t talk
that rot.”</p>

<p>“Come and see, sir,” said he, and his voice
shook.</p>

<p>They went into the hall with a lamp, and
Brown pointed with a shaking finger to a
portrait on the wall. There, gazing at them with a
sardonic smile, was Fletcher’s visitor, clear and
unmistakable.</p>

<p>A cold, numb feeling gathered round his heart,
but Fletcher realised that he must keep his nerve
at all costs.</p>

<p>“You must be right, I have been dreaming,”
he said in a voice he tried to make light. “Well,
I am very tired, let’s shut the place up, and
get off.”</p>

<p>Brown looked at him uneasily. “Very good,
sir, I shan’t be sorry,” he said. “The night’s
bad outside, but it’s worse here,” and he glanced
round the hall, where shadows flickered from the
lamplight.</p>

<p>The fire was nearly out, so they left it, and
locking up, made their way through the rank
vegetation, damp and unwholesome.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief Fletcher emerged from
the woods, and skirted the shore to the little
fishing village of Portham, now in complete
darkness.</p>

<p>“That’s the <i>Black Horse</i>, sir,” said Brown
pointing to a dark mass.</p>

<p>“Now look here, Brown, I want to impress on
you that I am here to find out all I can, and no
one must know what I am or they will be
suspicious of me. You understand?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir.”</p>

<p>“And you must not call me ‘sir,’ at all. I am
just an old friend of yours, what shall we say,
on a holiday after an illness. Now, goodbye, I
will go to the place alone; they know I am
coming?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I booked the room as you told me to.”</p>

<p>Fletcher waited till the constable had gone,
and then went to the door, and knocked. After
some time a light showed inside, and the door was
opened. The landlord, a black-looking,
shock-headed man with streaks of grey in his hair,
stood in the doorway. “Good-evening,” said
Fletcher, “my name is Fletcher. I have booked
a room here.”</p>

<p>The landlord, Southgate, eyed him with
suspicion, and muttered something about waiting up
for him, but Fletcher was used to dealing with
all classes of men, and quickly summed his host
up. With apologies for his lateness, which he
put down to having lost his way in the storm,
he asked mine host whether he would join him
with some liquid refreshment, and suggested
whiskey; he himself was quite done up, and too
tired for food.</p>

<p>Having closed and locked the door, the
landlord conducted him into an old dirty room, black
with smoke, which had a wonderful old fireplace
whereon a fire was burning, and black beams in
the ceiling. A cloth was spread on the table on
which was cold beef and bread.</p>

<p>Soon they were sitting by the fire discussing
hot grog, which the landlord prepared with
practiced skill. He was the descendant of a long line
of smugglers, and was not slow in telling
Fletcher what he thought about the bungalow
town, and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Fletcher was too tired for conversation, but
determined to get on good terms with Southgate
the landlord, and so they gossipped on till he felt
himself nodding, and with a “good-night” to the
landlord, retired for the night.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch106">

<h2>Chapter VI. <br> Portham-on-Sea</h2>

<p>Fletcher was up early, and after a good
breakfast, set out to walk to Bungalow
Town. The day was clear, and the events of the
night before appeared less sombre, in the light of
the morning. Of course, there must be some
logical and common-sense explanation for it all.
He had all the papers connected with the inquest,
and there were several people he wanted to see.</p>

<p>The walk did him good, and his mind was clear
when he rounded the headland and came in sight
of the bungalows. It was indeed a hideous place.
At one end was an unfinished row of gaunt shops
of which only a few had been opened. The
builder had made some attempt at decoration by
planting two rows of palms in tubs along the
road, which gave the place a bizarre appearance.
The first building he came to was a large
corrugated iron bungalow, styled the Club, which all
bungalow dwellers were invited to join for a
small subscription according to a notice board.
It had a withered tennis court, a bathing shed,
and a license, and in the summer the place was
much patronised. Fletcher made his way along
the muddy road, to where a large board bore the
legend “Estate Office.”</p>

<p>Entering he found a little, short-sighted man
with sandy hair getting thin. He looked up
wearily as Fletcher came in.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cook, I believe?” said the latter.</p>

<p>“That is my name,” said he, and waited.</p>

<p>“I came to ask you what bungalows you have
for sale?” said Fletcher with that disregard for
truth, which seems to be permitted to detectives.</p>

<p>Soon they were deeply engrossed with plans
and photos. Fletcher worked the conversation
round by easy stages to the subject of the
murder, and found little difficulty in getting Cook
to talk.</p>

<p>“It’s not been a bad thing for us,” he said, “it’s
given the place a splendid advert. Pictures were
in the papers, and quite a lot of people have been
down here.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you knew Lord Reckavile quite
well?” said Fletcher knowing how the flattery
would please.</p>

<p>“I can hardly say that, but I used to take his
ground rents to him; when he came back he
would send for me. He was a queer customer,
and allowed me to collect all the rents till he came
to England, and then pay him in cash. He said
he went off so suddenly that it was useful.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s plausible enough,” said the other.</p>

<p>“I had paid over quite a large sum to him on
the very day he was murdered.”</p>

<p>Fletcher looked up quickly.</p>

<p>“Really! I did not see …” and then stopped.</p>

<p>Luckily Cook was not taking much notice.</p>

<p>“I read the account of the affair,” Fletcher
continued, “but I did not see that mentioned.”</p>

<p>“I did not see that much could be gained by
saying anything,” said Cook, showing some signs
of confusion.</p>

<p>“That’s most interesting,” said Fletcher
casually, “what did you pay him in?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, I do not keep the money
here, but I always bank it at Ashstead. When
he wanted paying I drew it out.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Then the bank manager would have
the number of the notes?”</p>

<p>“Of course, they were five and ten pound
notes; he entered them all in his book. I did not
keep a record.”</p>

<p>Fletcher felt he was asking too many questions.</p>

<p>“What do you think about it?” he said, leaning
back in his chair.</p>

<p>“I believe he was afraid of something. He
was always running off abroad, and back again,
like a man hunted by something.”</p>

<p>“You mean the Curse?” said Fletcher in irony.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Cook gravely.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cook, you don’t tell me that as a man of
the world you believe in that superstition,
especially after what you have told me about the
money!”</p>

<p>“Don’t misunderstand me,” said the other,
“the villagers will tell you something outside the
pale, but I have it in mind that there is something
much more tangible; something connected with
the past, perhaps, and I am not at all sure that
that ruffian Southgate at the <i>Black Horse</i> does
not know a bit about it. He came here the other
day wanting to buy a bungalow, and I am sure
he never made the money out of that old pub
of his.”</p>

<p>After talking on general matters for a few
minutes, Fletcher took his leave.</p>

<p>As he made his way along the road deep in
thought, he was aware of two people coming to
meet him. They were conversing in eager tones,
and did not notice him. One of the two was Miss
Sefton, the other a tall good-looking young man
with light hair.</p>

<p>Fletcher greeted them and was introduced to
Jack Sefton by his sister. He was quick to
notice that there was a restless worried look about
the man, as though his nerve had gone. They
turned together and walked along the foreshore.</p>

<p>“What do you think of this place, Mr.
Fletcher?” said Ena.</p>

<p>Before he could reply Sefton had intervened.</p>

<p>“It’s a rotten show,” he said, “and you will
be bored to death before long. I am sick of it
already.”</p>

<p>Ena looked at her brother as though surprised
at his tone, but he stopped and said bitterly:</p>

<p>“You see, beggars can’t be choosers, and my
sister and I are compelled to live in this
God-forsaken hole until the visitors come, and then I
suppose we shall be kicked out.”</p>

<p>It was a strange outburst to a mere stranger.</p>

<p>“Come and see our bungalow,” said the girl
hastily, and they walked on in silence.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the house, Fletcher was
surprised to find a very charming bungalow, with
a central lounge, from which the other rooms
opened, tastefully furnished, and very pleasant
after the desolate appearance outside, where
most of the bungalows were shut up for the
winter.</p>

<p>“What a charming little place,” he said, “I
could enjoy a holiday here very well.”</p>

<p>He saw a look of gratitude on the girl’s face,
but Sefton said, “A holiday, yes. But supposing
you were condemned to live here all the year
round, you would find it different.” He glanced
round as though looking for something, and then
sprang to his feet. “Come and see our Club,”
he said with a harsh laugh.</p>

<p>“Have you got a Club here then?”</p>

<p>“Oh! It is called a Club,” he replied, “it is a
sort of tin shanty, but we can get a decent drink
there, and one can talk.”</p>

<p>Fletcher was surprised at his manner, but one
glance at his eyes showed him that there was a
devil biting him. With apologies to Ena, whose
company he preferred to that of her brother, he
made his way to the bungalow referred to, and
was soon deep in conversation. After all, duty
came before pleasure, and he was down here to
find the solution to the problem, not to talk to a
pretty girl.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sefton in answer to a question, “I
was mixed up with this business. When I got
there the man was as dead as mutton—it did not
require much skill to tell that; it is a curious
thing too …”</p>

<p>“What?” said Fletcher quite casually.</p>

<p>Sefton seemed to take a decision.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t mind telling you, but I didn’t
see any point in telling the police. It was most
curious, but I did not want to be accused of
sensationalism. You know the chairs in the room
had been overturned, as though there had been
a struggle, there was blood on some of them, and
on the floor. Well, I have enough medical
knowledge to know that the clean stab which
killed the man could not have caused all that
amount of blood.”</p>

<p>“You mean …?” said Fletcher.</p>

<p>“I mean,” said the other, leaning forward,
“that the blood came from the assailant whoever
he was. It was impossible to have come from
Reckavile.”</p>

<p>“That is interesting,” said Fletcher.</p>

<p>There was a pause, then Sefton went on.</p>

<p>“That is not all. Of course, this is only
between ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Fletcher.</p>

<p>“If you read the reports you will appreciate
what I am going to say. I bent down to examine
one of the overturned armchairs, the constable
was holding the light and it shone full on the
chair. Stretched from the leg to the floor there
was a spider’s web—a fully formed one.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure?” asked Fletcher.</p>

<p>“Quite, and I turned the chair over—there was
a deep depression underneath on the soft carpet,
and for another thing, the blood was dry, in most
places, I passed my hands over the stains—though
some was not …” he added musingly.</p>

<p>“Let’s have another drink,” said Fletcher to
hide his excitement.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch107">

<h2>Chapter VII. <br> In the Dark Night</h2>

<p>Fletcher was satisfied with his day’s
work. He returned to the <i>Black Horse</i>
tired and hungry. Here at any rate were clues
in abundance if he could only piece them
together.</p>

<p>After a substantial meal he wrote out his
report for Sinclair, and having smoked a
contemplative pipe, he sought his landlord.</p>

<p>He found him also smoking, and in a surly
mood, but with the aid of spirituous liquid he was
able to thaw his reserve.</p>

<p>It appeared that business was slack, and he
spent a great part of his time at his old trade of
fishing. Only when Fletcher tried to work the
conversation round to the affair at Reckavile
Castle, the landlord shut up like an oyster.</p>

<p>As the night advanced, however, he became a
little more communicative. A second bottle had
been opened, from which the landlord helped
himself liberally, and Fletcher with caution. The
night had turned rough, and the wind was rising.
Fletcher listened for a moment, and then said:</p>

<p>“Do you get many wrecks round these parts?”
and knocked out his pipe against the old
fireplace.</p>

<p>“I don’t recall as ther’s ben one for nigh on
thirty year,” said the other helping himself to
another drink. “That were when old Reckavile
came home.”</p>

<p>Fletcher pricked up his ears and waited.</p>

<p>“ ’E were mad, like ’em all,” continued the
landlord “and ’e swore ’e would land, weather or
no. ’E’d come over from France in a ’urry. ’E
raved and swore, and wouldn’t go to Port like a
sensible man.</p>

<p>“The Skipper ’e was a Frenchy, and Reckavile
’eld a pistol to ’is ’ead, and told ’im to put ’im
ashore. They launched a boat somehow, but it
overturned as any sensible man would ’a known.
’Ow the rest got ashore I don’t know. They all
sat in this very room shivering and chatting in
their lingo, but Lord Reckavile ’e was washed
ashore that night.”</p>

<p>Fletcher waited; a sudden gust of wind swept
round the inn, and smoke blew into the room.</p>

<p>“There was a fine to do,” the landlord
continued “but ’e was the only one drownded, and
they being foreigners it was ’ushed up. The
Ketch was a total wreck, and the crew were sent
’ome.”</p>

<p>“What about his wife?”</p>

<p>A cunning look came into the man’s eyes.
“Oh! She was up at the castle; the new Lord
Reckavile was born that very night.”</p>

<p>“And that was how long ago?” said Fletcher.</p>

<p>“Thirty-two year come next March,” said he.</p>

<p>“Then Lord Reckavile was about thirty-two
when he was murdered?” he slipped out
unwarily.</p>

<p>The landlord darted him a look of suspicion.</p>

<p>“I dunno nothin’ about that. I ’ad no dealings
with this one,” he said and kicked the fire
savagely.</p>

<p>Without another word he finished his drink
and departed.</p>

<p>Fletcher could not sleep; either the wind or the
problem kept him awake. At last he rose and
went to the table for matches; he would read, but
at the window he paused. The curtains did not
meet, and through the crack he could see a faint
light in the roadway outside. He gently drew
it back, and below he could dimly make out a
muffled figure standing by the door, holding a
ship’s lantern.</p>

<p>The door opened cautiously as he watched and
another figure in oilskins came out whom he had
no difficulty in recognising as the landlord.</p>

<p>Without a word they turned and went into the
night.</p>

<p>Fletcher waited. What should he do? He had
not come prepared for midnight expeditions in
the rain, and it was a wild night. At last his
sense of adventure got the better of him, and
hastily dressing, he slipped downstairs, and
seized his greatcoat from the peg in the hall.</p>

<p>As he approached the front door, a voice called
over the bannisters.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“It is only I … Mr. Fletcher,” said he,
feeling a fool.</p>

<p>He saw the vision of Mrs. Southgate in very
negligee costume, leaning over the stairs, and
behind her a dim suggestion of a domestic and felt
some explanation was called for.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a noise, and came to see
what it was,” he said lamely. He felt far from
being a hero with these two females watching
him, and the worst part was that he was quite
sure they were really laughing at him, under the
guise of being frightened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Southgate spoke.</p>

<p>“Oh! I expect you heard my ’usband going out
a-fishing. ’E always tries ’is luck about this
time. But Lord, ’ow you did frighten me, Mr.
Fletcher! You see when my ’usband goes it’s so
lonely, and what with the storm, and the
neighbours not being too respectable.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” said he irritably, to shut her up,
and he made his way to his room.</p>

<p>“A pretty detective you are,” he said bitterly
to himself as he slipped into bed.</p>

<p>The morning was bright and clear, and the
storm had abated.</p>

<p>As he wandered out of the house the first sight
which met him was the innkeeper, hanging out a
damp net to dry. For a change he greeted him
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Mornin’ sir,” he said “we ’ad a rough night;
my missus says you was scared in the night.
Lord, no one would come to my place; I expect
you ’eard me a-goin’ out.”</p>

<p>“Had any luck?” said Fletcher, knowing quite
well, even as a townsman, that the night was far
too rough for fishing.</p>

<p>“Pretty fair, sir, pretty fair.”</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by the
appearance of Brown striding towards the inn.
Fletcher cast a shrewd look towards the
innkeeper, but he was quite unperturbed.</p>

<p>The constable saluted. “May I have a word
with you, sir?” he said.</p>

<p>“Come inside,” replied Fletcher with an angry
look.</p>

<p>Once within the room he shut the door, and
turned on Brown.</p>

<p>“You damned fool, what do you mean by
coming here and saluting, after what I told you.
You’ve fairly messed things up.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, sir,” said the constable abashed,
taking off his helmet. “I never thought of it. I
wanted to come and tell you the news.”</p>

<p>“Go on then.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, you told me to watch the castle; I
didn’t like the job, but I walked round, and
about one o’clock I saw a light inside. You know
what a rough night it was, and it fairly gave me
the creeps, but I thought I had to do my duty,
so I opened the front door, and crept to the
library where the light was. My hair was fairly
lifting on my head.</p>

<p>“When I got to the door, there I saw two men
bending over the desk, and a lantern between
them.”</p>

<p>“Did you recognise them?”</p>

<p>Brown looked confused.</p>

<p>“No, sir, they were too cunning for me. As
I crept forward I fell right over on my face.
They had stretched a wire across the doorway.
When I got up the light was gone, and so were
they, and the window open.”</p>

<p>In spite of his annoyance Fletcher laughed.</p>

<p>“Stick to your duties as a village constable,
Brown,” he said, “you will never make a
detective. Well what happened?”</p>

<p>“I gave chase,” said the rueful constable, “but
it was no good, the night was too wild. So I
thought I’d better come and see you before
reporting it to Sergeant Andrews who is my Chief
here.”</p>

<p>Fletcher ignored him for a moment, and took
a turn up and down the room.</p>

<p>He glanced at the window and saw the
innkeeper, still hanging out his nets.</p>

<p>“All right, Brown,” he said at last “the
mischief is done, but I can’t stay here any more.
You’d better make a report for Andrews. You
saw nothing else?”</p>

<p>“Nothing appeared to have been touched, and
they had left nothing behind. I examined the
desk, but it seems to have been intact; you know,
sir, it has already been searched.”</p>

<p>Fletcher dismissed him, and turned to his
correspondence and breakfast.</p>

<p>A letter from the bank manager at Ashstead
contained the numbers of the missing bank notes
for which he had telephoned. He put it in his
pocket. Then a thought came to him, and he
rang the bell.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I must get back to London
to-day,” he said to the innkeeper’s wife. “Please
let me have my bill.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry sir,” she said, “I ’ope as ’ow it’s
not because of you being frightened in the night,
sir.”</p>

<p>There was a note of raillery in the voice which
was most galling.</p>

<p>He made no answer, and in due course an
illiterate scrawl was brought which indicated by
its total that piracy still ran in the blood of these
people. Fletcher produced a ten pound note; it
was a long shot but worth trying.</p>

<p>“Could you oblige me with change?” he said.</p>

<p>“I’ll see, sir,” said the woman, and retired.</p>

<p>He saw her call her husband, and a colloquy
took place.</p>

<p>Presently she reappeared; on the plate was a
five pound note and some loose silver. This was
not the type of house where five pound notes are
flung about, so when the door was shut he
produced his letter.</p>

<p>With a thrill he saw by the number that it was
one of the missing notes. Then a doubt came;
surely these people were not quite so simple as
that; all their conduct was against it.</p>

<p>He rang the bell, for the time for further
disguise had passed.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me,” he said sternly, “where you
got this note?”</p>

<p>The woman gave a baffling look of innocent
surprise.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir, I’ll ask my husband.”</p>

<p>She returned with the innkeeper, who had the
same air of innocence.</p>

<p>“That note, sir, we doesn’t ’ave notes ’ere as a
rule, but I changed this for young Mr. Sefton,
the medico from the Bungalows. ’E ’ad some
food ’ere t’other day.”</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be done here, so
taking his bag, he departed, but he had not gone
far towards Bungalow Town, where he was
determined to stay, when he was met by Sergeant
Andrews with startling news.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch108">

<h2>Chapter VIII. <br> “The Red Cote”</h2>

<p>Sergeant Andrews was a shrewd
man and ambitious. He had been rather
offended when the Reckavile case had been taken
out of his hands, and was not particularly pleased
when he heard that an official as young as
Fletcher had been sent down by Scotland Yard,
but he showed nothing of this in his manner when
he addressed him.</p>

<p>“I am pleased to meet you,” he said, “Brown
told me you were working down here, and of
course I was informed by the Yard that you were
coming. How are you getting on?”</p>

<p>“It is difficult to say at present, I have a mass
of information that must be sorted out, for it
seems to be a complicated affair; but you wanted
to see me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose you have heard of the
disappearance of the bank manager, Summers, of
Tunbridge Wells?”</p>

<p>“Just what I have read, that’s all, he was last
seen at Portham Junction, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“That is as far as the official report goes, but
I have further information.” Andrews took the
other by the arm, and glanced round to see that
no one was listening.</p>

<p>“He has been seen here in Bungalow Town,”
he added.</p>

<p>Fletcher gave a start. “Are you sure?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt of it; there is a bungalow
called <i>The Red Cote</i> which has somehow got a
sinister reputation in the village—I do not know
why—and we have been keeping our eye on it
for some days. It is apparently unoccupied, but
every night the rooms are lighted up. I had a
special man to watch it, as in a place like this
with so many empty bungalows in the winter,
there is a great chance for burglars. For three
nights running two men have been seen lurking
round the place, and my man swears one of them
is the missing bank manager.”</p>

<p>“And the other?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is more difficult to say, and if we
knew that we might find out a lot of things. The
nights were dark, and they evidently tried to
avoid observation, but we have our suspicions.
Now for the past three days no trace has been
seen of Summers, and the other man has been
seen alone, so it looks bad.”</p>

<p>While they had been talking, Andrews had
lead the way along the beach to the bungalow
which had been the subject of conversation. It
was innocent enough to look at, consisting of two
railway coaches set parallel to each other with a
lounge between, and was furnished with violet
basket chairs and sofa, and a green carpet. The
door was locked but as there were no curtains or
blinds, it was possible to see the whole interior.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it?” asked Andrews.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing remarkable about it that I
can see, and I really don’t know why you attach
so much importance to seeing two strangers
about at night time.”</p>

<p>“Have a look at the back,” said Andrews with
a smile.</p>

<p>Fletcher did so, and returned to the other.
“Well,” he said “there’s just a little kitchen.”</p>

<p>Andrews assumed an air of mystery.</p>

<p>“You see this sitting room, what do you make
its length by guessing?”</p>

<p>Fletcher put his eye to the window. “About
twelve feet, I should say,” he said.</p>

<p>“Right, and the kitchen at the back I make
about five feet in depth. Very well, that makes
roughly seventeen feet in all, but these railway
coaches are thirty-five feet in length, and the
question is, what is in between?”</p>

<p>Fletcher became interested. “By Jove, I
believe you have got hold of something,” he said.
“We’d better have a look.”</p>

<p>Andrews demurred. “We can’t get in without
committing a burglary,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh nonsense,” said Fletcher, “there’s no one
about, here goes,” and with a quick movement he
swung himself up to the roof, and crawled along
the top; in a few moments he was back again,
dusting his knees.</p>

<p>“You are right, Andrews,” he said “there is
something funny here, there’s a glass window
lighting a central room, but it is whitened all
over, to make it impossible to see inside. I
wonder if our friend is merely an amateur
photographer, and we are making fools of ourselves, or
whether it has some other meaning.”</p>

<p>“I thought as you are down here, you would
like to know, and I suggest that we two watch
to-night, and see what happens, there’s nothing
like doing a thing one’s self, and it’s just possible
this may lead you to the solution of your
problem as well.”</p>

<p>Fletcher was all attention. “There may be
something in what you say, it’s worth trying
anyhow. I’ll meet you at ten o’clock. I have had
to leave the <i>Black Horse</i>, and am trying to get
a room at what they call the Club, it’s nearer to
the scene of action.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Andrews. “At ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>Fletcher made his way in a thoughtful mood
to the Seftons’ bungalow. He wanted to see
Sefton, and it must be admitted he also felt
strangely drawn to the girl of the train.</p>

<p>Ena let him in herself, and a tall man rose to
his feet, and was introduced to him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Halley,” said the girl. “This is Mr.
Fletcher about whom I told you.”</p>

<p>The two men shook hands with a curious
feeling of antagonism, for which Fletcher was
unable to account.</p>

<p>“I am sorry my brother is out,” said Ena.
“Mr. Halley has been very kind in putting our
wireless set right, and it has made a great
difference to us in the evenings, as there are no
amusements in the village.”</p>

<p>“You are living in Portham, Mr. Halley?”
asked Fletcher.</p>

<p>“My health has not been good,” replied the
other in a frigid tone, which Ena was quick to
notice was very different from his normal voice.
“And I find the air of this place does me good.”</p>

<p>“And have you been here long?” asked
Fletcher with a disregard for courtesy.</p>

<p>“A few weeks only,” replied the other.</p>

<p>Fletcher was puzzled, for there was a haunting
suggestion in his mind that he had met Halley
before, though he could not recollect where or
when he had done so. He could not continue to
ask questions of a stranger he had just met, but
made a mental note for further inquiry.</p>

<p>“I hope you have succeeded in getting a
suitable bungalow, Mr. Fletcher,” said Ena.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Miss Sefton, but I have my eye on
one called <i>The Red Cote</i> which seems to be
empty. Do you know it?”</p>

<p>“Only by sight,” she replied, but Fletcher had
been watching Halley out of the corner of his
eye, and saw him give a slight start at the name.</p>

<p>Somehow he felt in the way, as though he were
not quite welcome, and the thought vexed him;
he was annoyed to find Halley so much at home,
and turning to him he said, “Are you coming my
way by any chance?”</p>

<p>“That depends on where you are going to,”
answered Halley with a frigid smile.</p>

<p>“I was just going to the Club to see whether
I could get a room for a day or two; it will be
more comfortable than the <i>Black Horse</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh you’ve been staying there, have you? How
did you like our friend Southgate?” There was
a shade of raillery in the tone which annoyed
Fletcher, and he replied with more heat than he
intended. “Is he a friend of yours? In my
opinion he is a confounded ruffian.”</p>

<p>“Quite possibly,” said Halley unruffled. “I
expect if he had lived some time ago he would
have been a smuggler or a pirate.”</p>

<p>“And now he’s very likely a thief,” said
Fletcher unguardedly.</p>

<p>“How jolly! Like the Pirates of Penzance,
you remember.… ‘Let’s vary Piracy with
a little Burglary’.”</p>

<p>Fletcher saw he must keep his temper, and
said stiffly:</p>

<p>“I am afraid I have never seen that play.
Well, I must get along, Miss Sefton,” and took
his departure.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to like Mr. Fletcher?” said
Ena when he had gone.</p>

<p>“I neither like or dislike him,” replied Halley.
“He strikes me as an inquisitive busybody, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“Look there,” said Halley pointing out of the
window “who’s that with him now?”</p>

<p>Ena looked and saw Fletcher and her brother
walking slowly towards the Club deep in
conversation.</p>

<h2>Chapter IX. <br> The Mysterious Bungalow</h2>

<p>When Jack Sefton got home that night,
he found his sister waiting for him in a
mood in which he had seldom seen her. It was
late, and he would have slipped off to bed, but
she stopped him.</p>

<p>“Jack, I want to know why you persistently
try to avoid meeting Mr. Halley. He has been
most kind, and it makes things very unpleasant
for me when I keep on telling him that you will
be in, and each time you are out. Then to-day,
you were walking with Mr. Fletcher and must
have known Mr. Halley was here, but you never
took the trouble to come in.”</p>

<p>After the manner of men who know
themselves in the wrong, he worked himself up into a
temper.</p>

<p>“Why should I meet this fellow? You have
scratched up a friendship with him, and you
know nothing about him. I think you should
have waited till I had seen him before you
became so pally.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with her clear eyes. “What
has come over you, Jack, lately? It is your
duty to be at home sometimes. If you were
working I would be only too pleased, but you are
away all day, and I don’t know where you get
to.” She laid a hand on his arm. “Please don’t
think I want to inquire into your affairs, but I
am so much alone, and so worried about the
future.” There were tears in her voice.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, old girl, but give me a few weeks
and I will explain everything. Don’t worry me
now.”</p>

<p>“Very well, but there is one thing I must
trouble you with; I am sorry but I have no money
to carry on with. We cannot run up bills here,
and you know I have always paid cash for
everything.”</p>

<p>A look of relief came over his face. “You poor
child,” he said. “Is that all? Why didn’t you
tell me?”</p>

<p>He put his hand into his coat pocket, and
produced a bundle of notes. “This will do to go on
with,” he said, laying down three five pound
notes.</p>

<p>A look of fear came to Ena’s eyes, and a vague
terror clutched her heart.</p>

<p>“Where did you get this money from?” she
asked, shrinking from the notes as though they
were poisoned.</p>

<p>“Oh, just a story I wrote for the magazines,”
he said airily.</p>

<p>“What magazine? You never told me.”</p>

<p>“An American paper,” he answered, and then
with sudden anger, “Do you think I stole it?
If so, say so.”</p>

<p>“I can’t take them, Jack.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense! It was a little surprise I
had for you. You would rather have smaller
ones? All right, I’ll change them and give you
pound notes.”</p>

<p>He picked them up, and strode from the room.</p>

<p>She sat long in the darkness gazing out at the
dim sea, desolate and menacing. She wanted
company badly, someone in whom she could
confide. Then there came a knock at the door, she
almost feared to go, but it was such a gentle tap.
She opened the door and saw Halley in the
doorway.</p>

<p>“Miss Sefton,” he said, hurriedly raising his
hat. “I must apologise for coming at this hour,
and if your brother is not at home, of course, I
will not come in, but I want to help you if I
can.”</p>

<p>“What is it? You frighten me.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry. It was really your brother I
wanted to see. I wanted to ask him what he does
at <i>The Red Cote</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i>The Red Cote</i>, the bungalow without blinds?”
she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded gravely. “Believe me it is of the
utmost importance, the police will be here
directly.”</p>

<p>Her hand sought her throat. “Police?” she
gasped. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You know <i>The Red Cote</i>?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do, the house without blinds
they call it in the village. Come in,” Ena said,
“I did not want you to stand outside, but your
coming was so unexpected; I will tell my
brother.”</p>

<p>She led him into the sitting room, and he
lighted a lamp for her. Suddenly he turned.
“You were all in the dark?” he said, and there
was a tender note in his voice.</p>

<p>Without another word she went and called her
brother.</p>

<p>He came in and the two men met at last. “This
is Mr. Halley—my brother,” she said.</p>

<p>Sefton looked at Halley, and started with a
puzzled look on his face, and half turned back to
his room. With an effort he pulled himself
together, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“I am glad to meet you,” he said “and thank
you for what you have done for my sister,” but
there was a false ring in his voice which Ena was
quick to notice.</p>

<p>Halley spoke rapidly. “Mr. Sefton, I wish I
had met you before; now I am afraid I come on
a rather unpleasant business. I am sorry. I
want you to believe me a friend; I will do
anything to help.”</p>

<p>“What on earth do you mean?” asked Jack
crossly.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you one question; please don’t
think me impertinent; what do you do at <i>The
Red Cote</i>?”</p>

<p>Sefton staggered for a moment, and then sat
heavily on a chair. His face was ghastly.</p>

<p>“<i>The Red Cote</i>?” he said in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>A loud knock sounded at the door, and both
Sefton and his sister were frozen in their places,
while Halley rose and walked across the room
and opened the door. Outside three men were
standing—Fletcher, Sergeant Andrews, and
Brown the Constable. It was Andrews who
spoke.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Sefton inside?”</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Halley. “I am a friend and
was calling on them when I heard you knock.”</p>

<p>Without a word the men entered; Fletcher
appeared very uncomfortable and would not look
at Ena.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sefton,” said Andrews, “we are sorry to
intrude on you at this time of night, and I must
apologise to you, Miss Sefton,” he continued,
bowing to the girl, “but we wish to ask you one
or two questions, perhaps you would prefer to
come outside with us.”</p>

<p>Sefton’s face was white and set, but he seemed
to take a sudden resolution.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “you can ask any questions you
like here, you have plenty of witnesses,” and he
threw his hand round with a nervous gesture.</p>

<p>“In the first place, can you give us any
information with regard to the mysterious
disappearance of Summers, the missing bank manager?”</p>

<p>“I can give no information whatever,” he
replied.</p>

<p>Andrews continued. “Can you tell us in that
case, what you were doing with Summers at the
bungalow called <i>The Red Cote</i>?”</p>

<p>“I refuse to give you any information
whatever,” replied Sefton starting to his feet.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sefton, you are behaving in a strange
way,” said Andrews sternly.</p>

<p>“Are you bringing an accusation against me?”</p>

<p>“Not at present,” said the sergeant gravely,
“but I think it would be better for you to be
open with us. All three of us saw you distinctly
go to <i>The Red Cote</i> and open it with a key this
very evening, though how you got out is a
mystery. Some few days ago Mr. Summers, in
company with a man, we know now to be yourself,
was seen to go into the same bungalow. If there
is a plain, straightforward explanation, why do
you not tell us?”</p>

<p>Sefton looked round like a hunted animal.</p>

<p>“I tell you there is no crime and no mystery,
and in a few days I can clear the matter up; at
present I will say nothing.”</p>

<p>Halley had approached the girl during this
conversation, and stood as though protecting her;
he now spoke for the first time.</p>

<p>“I am quite sure that Mr. Sefton is only
keeping you in ignorance of the facts from some
perfectly honourable motive,” said he quietly.</p>

<p>Brown the constable started, and looked at
Halley as though he had seen a ghost, his face
became suffused with red, and Fletcher turned
in surprise to him. “What is the matter, Brown?”
he said.</p>

<p>The constable collected himself. “Nothing,
sir,” he said “but I could have sworn …”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by Sergeant Andrews.</p>

<p>“This is very unsatisfactory, but if you refuse
to say anything, we can take no further steps at
present,” he added significantly.</p>

<p>Fletcher was torn between duty and another
feeling. He was longing to ask Sefton how he
came to be possessed of one of the missing notes,
but he knew that such a question would make
Ena turn against him, so he would defer it for
the moment.</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause. Brown was
furtively looking at Halley, and there was a
puzzled look on his face as if he were trying to recall
something to mind which eluded him, while
Sefton was nervously twisting his fingers in and out.</p>

<p>And then with startling suddenness the clock
struck the hour of twelve.</p>

<p>“We can do no more here,” said Fletcher.</p>

<p>“We? I don’t understand,” said Ena coldly.</p>

<p>“I ought to explain,” said Fletcher.
“Sergeant Andrews is an old friend of mine, and
asked me to watch <i>The Red Cote</i> with him,
though of course I had no idea it had anything
to do with your brother.”</p>

<p>“A sort of spy,” said Ena, with contempt, and
there was an ominous glitter in her eye.</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t think that,” he said. “I
thought it was just an adventure.”</p>

<p>Rather shamefacedly the men trooped out of
the room.</p>

<p>When the door had closed, Sefton went up to
Halley, and held out his hand. “If you don’t
mind shaking hands with a man under
suspicion,” he said “I want to apologise for my
seeming rudeness.”</p>

<p>Halley understood and shook hands with a
hearty grip.</p>

<p>“You need not say anything. I believe I can
guess something at any rate; you may rely on
me.”</p>

<p>Tears came into Ena’s eyes in spite of herself,
if this man could trust her brother, what right
had she to have doubts?</p>

<p>“Jack, I will believe you, but do clear up the
whole thing, dear.”</p>

<p>“At the end of next week,” he said as though
taking a sudden decision.</p>

<p>“Thank God for that,” she said, and they
parted for the night.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch110">

<h2>Chapter X. <br> In the Churchyard</h2>

<p>Ena Sefton was on her way to the
village church on Sunday morning. It was the
old church which had stood there for centuries,
long before such a thing as a bungalow town was
heard of. She was rather late and the bell was
already ringing, so she quickened her pace. A
long avenue of trees led up to the old
churchyard, and as she rounded the corner she saw
Halley walking slowly in front of her, and
somehow it came as a shock to her, for she had not
associated him with church-going. He turned
and when he saw her he raised his hat with a
smile of welcome.</p>

<p>“I did not know that you usually patronised
our village church,” she said.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I cannot claim to do much in that
line,” he answered “but I really came here for
another object; I am interested in old
inscriptions, and I am told there are some in this
churchyard.”</p>

<p>They walked along together, and passed
through the Lych Gate. “Are you coming in?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“I hardly think so, if you will not think it rude
of me, but I will wait in the churchyard for you
if I may.”</p>

<p>When the simple service was over, she found
him standing at the corner of the churchyard
where the Reckavile family vault was situated.
He was deep in thought and did not look up until
she touched him lightly, then he gave a start.</p>

<p>“You were looking at the graves of the past
Lord Reckaviles?” she asked.</p>

<p>His face clouded over. “It is an ugly record,”
he said. In front of them was the tomb of the
last Lord Reckavile, a simple stone tablet giving
his name, and age, and the date of his death, and
beneath, the sombre words “Vengeance is mine
and I will repay.” Beyond that was the tomb of
his father drowned at sea, whose body had been
washed ashore.</p>

<p>“Age thirty-two,” he said in a puzzled tone,
“it is strange.” And he turned with her and
walked by her side without speaking.</p>

<p>“Mr. Halley,” she said to break the silence,
“you will please forgive me asking this question,
but you seem so entirely alone, I have often
wondered whether you have any relations living.
You don’t mind, do you?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least, Miss Sefton,” he replied with
that peculiar sad smile of his “I can answer the
question very simply. I have no relations, and
no friends.”</p>

<p>“That is unkind of you,” she said “surely you
count us as friends.”</p>

<p>“I would like to think so,” he said “but we
have only known each other a short time.”</p>

<p>“Do you think friendship must necessarily be
a growth of years?” she asked.</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” he replied, “I believe that
when people meet for the first time they are
either friends or not, there is a sort of instinctive
affinity or repulsion, although it may not be felt
at the moment.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with a roguish smile. “And
which was it in my case?” she said.</p>

<p>He did not answer to her mood. “You are on
dangerous ground, you do not know who you
are taking as a friend.” There was almost a note
of warning in his voice. He had always been
reserved and self-contained, but of a sudden he
stopped and said with emotion:</p>

<p>“Would to God I had never come to
England!”</p>

<p>She was startled, for it was the first revelation
of what had been dimly at the back of her mind,
that he was not entirely English.</p>

<p>He collected himself, and then walked on.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, for forgetting myself, perhaps I
ought to tell you I was born in Italy and my
mother was Italian, although my father was
English. I shall be going back soon, when my
work is over.”</p>

<p>“Your work!” she said.</p>

<p>“I have a task to accomplish,” he said in a
solemn tone “and I cannot allow my thoughts to
stray to—other things. What am I to do with
love or the lighter side of life?” It was almost
as though he was talking to himself, but a deep
blush spread over Ena’s face, and she turned her
head away.</p>

<p>As they emerged from the churchyard avenue
the village was spread out below them in all its
hideousness, like some great Fair, when the show
is over. As they came to the foreshore, a figure
rose over the bank from the beach. It was
Fletcher, and a look of annoyance crossed his
face when he saw Halley, although he tried to
hide it.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Sefton, I suppose you
have been to church. I should hardly have
thought that was in Mr. Halley’s line,” he said
with a sneer.</p>

<p>“Right,” said Halley. “I did not go to church,
but I met Miss Sefton there. I have been
looking at your interesting graveyard.”</p>

<p>“What a cheerful subject,” said the other. “I
am not much interested in tombstones myself.”</p>

<p>Halley darted a keen glance at him. “They
say,” he said, “there are sermons in stones, there
may be also stories on tombstones of even greater
interest and value.”</p>

<p>“Well, I prefer something a little more
amusing,” said Fletcher, and there was something in
his tone which seemed to anger Halley.</p>

<p>Very quietly he said, “I suppose the
investigation of crime is an amusing subject.”</p>

<p>Fletcher stopped dead, and his face went white.
“Crime!” he said “what on earth do you mean?”</p>

<p>Ena was looking from one to the other of the
two men.</p>

<p>“Only this,” said Halley lighting a cigarette,
“that as you are a Scotland Yard detective, I
suppose most of your life is spent in that way.”</p>

<p>“A Scotland Yard detective,” blurted out
Fletcher.</p>

<p>Halley held up his hand. “Please do not take
the trouble to deny it. I know you were sent
down by Scotland Yard to investigate the
murder.”</p>

<p>Fletcher’s mind was in a whirl, it was obviously
impossible to deny the statement made in such
an emphatic tone.</p>

<p>“How on earth do you know anything about
me?” said he unguardedly.</p>

<p>Halley shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“What about you?” said Fletcher angrily.
“Who and what are you? You have come here
from no one knows where, and have no apparent
occupation except loafing about and enquiring
into other people’s business, and imposing on
trusting girls.”</p>

<p>A look of contempt was on Ena’s face.</p>

<p>“Is it true, Mr. Fletcher? Are you really a
detective?”</p>

<p>“It is quite true, Miss Sefton, though how
your friend became acquainted with this, I do
not know.” There was an unpleasant emphasis
on the word “friend.” “I suppose you have no
objection to detectives?”</p>

<p>“A man’s business is his own,” she replied with
spirit, “but I do not like anyone who goes under
false pretences.”</p>

<p>Fletcher’s usual self-control was deserting him.
He saw the interest which this girl might have
had in him gone for ever.</p>

<p>“False pretences,” he repeated “and what
about him? Who is he? For all you know he
may be the criminal we are after.”</p>

<p>“If you are going to say things like that,” she
replied, “perhaps we had better say good-day,”
and she turned away without another word.</p>

<p>Halley gave one glance at the angry detective
and then followed her.</p>

<p>“All right, my boy!” said Fletcher to the
departing couple. “You’ve scored one point, but
wait until I have got a little more information
and then we will see what opinion Miss Ena will
hold of you!”</p>

<p>Ena walked in silence for a while.</p>

<p>“How horrible,” she said at length. “That
man came down with me by the same train, and
scratched up an acquaintance. I suppose he was
trying to ‘pump’ me, as they say; that is why he
came the other night, with the police sergeant.
I will never trust anyone again.”</p>

<p>Halley looked at her for a moment.</p>

<p>“Did I not tell you not to make friends at
sight?” he said bitterly, but she turned quickly to
him.</p>

<p>“Oh! I am so sorry, I did not mean that, of
course I was not referring to you.”</p>

<p>“But why not? You know as little about me
as you did about Fletcher.”</p>

<p>She was confused, and took refuge in his own
words.</p>

<p>“But then you said friendship was an
instinctive thing. I never took to Mr. Fletcher, though
I knew nothing against him, and he was a
stranger.”</p>

<p>The lunch at the Sefton’s bungalow was
cheerful, in spite of the cloud hanging over the affairs
of all three. Jack was a changed being now that
he had taken his resolve, and listened with
interest to the tales of foreign travel with which
Halley regaled them, for Halley was in a mood they
had never seen before. His usual gravity was
gone, and they realised what a wonderful talker
he could be when he liked, and in the days which
followed they looked back on this meal with
especial pleasure. The men had just settled to
smoke, when there came a hasty knock at the
door. Southgate was standing outside panting,
for he had walked fast, and his face was red,
but there was an anxious look in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Come away at once, Mr. Halley,” he said
urgently. “I have something to tell you.”</p>

<p>With apologies Halley went outside.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” he said when he returned to the
others “I must go with Southgate, and I am
afraid I shall have to go to London to-morrow.
I will get back as soon as I can.”</p>

<h2>Chapter XI. <br> The Meaning of “The Red Cote”</h2>

<p>The following Saturday Sefton was waiting
in his bungalow, and Ena was with him,
rather nervous, but glad that the shadow was to
be lifted at last. Jack had written to Andrews
to tell him that he was going to make an
explanation with regard to <i>The Red Cote</i>, and asked him
to be present. Fletcher he had deliberately
ignored, though he felt certain that he would turn
up. Halley had not returned from London, and
there had been no news of him.</p>

<p>Andrews arrived punctually to the minute,
and as was expected, Fletcher was with him.
Sefton found seats for them, and began in
quiet tones, different indeed from the irritable
manner of the past weeks.</p>

<p>“You asked me the other day, what I was
doing at <i>The Red Cote</i>. I am now in a position
to tell you, thank God. When my father died,
I had almost finished my course at the Hospital,
and was within sight of being a qualified doctor.
I was unable to go on through lack of funds.
Before he died, my father entrusted a secret to
me. He had been carrying out researches in
certain obscure nervous diseases. My father firmly
believed in Psychoanalysis, and had also a
special appliance of an electrical nature with which
he was experimenting.</p>

<p>“Not being qualified, I could not practice
openly, nor did I wish to reveal to the medical
world the exact nature of the process, until I
had thoroughly tested it. You will remember,
Ena,” he said turning to his sister, “that when
we first came here, I was writing a large number
of letters, and you thought that I was trying to
get work of some sort. My real object was to
get hold of patients, who wished to be treated
privately. I was obliged to take a bungalow for
the treatment, and was perhaps over-anxious to
keep the matter secret, so constructed a room in
which I could work, in the centre of the
bungalow. I rather foolishly thought that if the place
was lighted up it would be less conspicuous than
if it was in darkness, but it seems to have called
attention to it instead.</p>

<p>“I could not bring them here as they were
practically lunatics.</p>

<p>“Among my patients was Summers the bank
manager from Tunbridge Wells.” The
listeners gave a start of surprise.</p>

<p>“Summers was in a curious state when he came
to me,” Sefton continued. “He was not mad,
but was on the border-line, and I was afraid that
he would commit suicide. He should have told
his people, but I could see that the slightest
suggestion of such a thing would have spelt disaster.
He was convinced that he was dead. The
treatment was doing him good, and I had hopes that
he would make a complete recovery, when you
got busy over the so-called mystery, and I had
to exercise the utmost caution. Then Summers
disappeared.”</p>

<p>Andrews lifted his eyebrows and glanced at
Fletcher.</p>

<p>Sefton was quick to notice it. “No,” he said.
“I should not have been quite such a fool as to
tell you this story, if I could not produce the
man. He will be here presently, but for obvious
reasons an explanation was first necessary.”</p>

<p>“When you called on me I had no more idea
where he was than you had, and I could see that
if he had committed suicide, my position would
be black.”</p>

<p>Fletcher’s face was suffused with red, and he
banged the table.</p>

<p>“I see it all now,” he said. “Summers and
Halley are one and the same man. That’s what
he was doing here.”</p>

<p>There was a look of contempt on the face of
Sefton.</p>

<p>“If that’s what a detective is paid for I don’t
think much of the service. Wasn’t Halley here
last week when you came to ask questions? If
I am not mistaken here is Summers himself.”</p>

<p>In answer to a knock, Ena went to the door,
and admitted a tall man answering exactly to
the description given in the papers and on the
wireless of the missing man. He bowed to the
company, and shook hands with Sefton.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Summers,” said he introducing
him to the others.</p>

<p>Summers passed a nervous hand over his eyes,
and said “I am afraid I can’t talk much. I am
not very well, but thanks to Mr. Sefton I am
making a wonderful recovery. He has told me
I was wrong to run away, but I had dreams and
was haunted; now I can see things better.”</p>

<p>Ena went to him with the instinct of a true
woman. “My brother has been telling us all
about you. You will be all right now; you are
among friends, and must come and stop here till
you are well.”</p>

<p>A look of deep gratitude come to his thin face,
and he seemed calmer and more self-possessed.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said. “I have entire
confidence in your brother, and I will do whatever he
wishes.”</p>

<p>So here was the explanation of <i>The Red Cote</i>,
commonplace as all explanations are when you
hear them.</p>

<p>Fletcher felt that he had cut a poor figure, and
was eager to retrieve his reputation; he had
another shot in his locker, but to use this would
extinguish his last chance to stand well with Ena.
He glanced at her and hesitated. Andrews rose
to his feet.</p>

<p>“Your story has been quite interesting, and
as far as I am concerned, convincing,” he said
holding out his hand. “You could not have done
otherwise than you have done.”</p>

<p>“One moment,” said Fletcher, having made his
decision. “Mr. Sefton, can you explain with
equal ease how it was that you changed a five
pound note at the <i>Black Horse</i> with Southgate
which was one of those stolen from Lord
Reckavile?”</p>

<p>There was an ominous silence in the room;
Ena’s eyes flashed, while Andrews looked at the
floor, marvelling at the crudity of the question,
but Sefton remained calm.</p>

<p>“If you had asked your question in a less
offensive manner, I would have answered you; now
you can find out for yourself.”</p>

<p>He saw the look of pain in Ena’s eyes, and
remembered how worried she had been about the
money.</p>

<p>“But for my sister’s sake I will tell you,” he
added. “I have only changed one such note at
the <i>Black Horse</i>, and that was for old Giles. He
asked me whether I could change it for him, and
I did so. You can ask him yourself.”</p>

<p>“Humph,” said Fletcher, “we shall see about
that,” and he rose. “Come on, Andrews, we shall
do no more with these people.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch112">

<h2>Chapter XII. <br> The Unknown Speaker</h2>

<p>The whole case was getting on Fletcher’s
nerves. He had paid a visit to Giles, to
follow up the clue about the money.</p>

<p>The old man was quite straightforward; it was
true, he had asked Sefton to change a five pound
note for him, which had been given him by Lord
Reckavile as wages. When his Lordship was
away he never sent any money, but when he came
home, he had been in the habit of giving the old
servant quite large sums to carry on with.</p>

<p>It was quite possible, and there was nothing to
be said about this, but yet Fletcher felt somehow
that all these people were combining to thwart
his efforts and were secretly laughing at him.</p>

<p>What was Halley doing in Portham? And
what was Southgate up to in his nocturnal visit
to the castle, for he was sure that that was where
he had gone in the night, though he had no
definite proof.</p>

<p>Halley had returned from London, so much
he had learnt, and was again visiting the Sefton’s
bungalow, where Summers was now openly
staying as a paying guest, under Sefton’s care.</p>

<p>He returned from a troubled walk; his stay at
Portham was already lasting too long, and hints
from Headquarters had been thrown out that if
he could not manage the job, he had better
return.</p>

<p>He had allowed his thoughts to stray to the
fair grace of Ena Sefton, only to have the cup
dashed to the ground by the revelation of his
profession, as if there was anything to be
ashamed of in being a detective. It was better
than an unknown adventurer anyhow, he kept
on telling himself in self pity.</p>

<p>He arrived at the Club in a despondent mood,
and was met by Brown, the constable.</p>

<p>The latter had an air of mystery about him.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it, Brown,” he asked “anything
fresh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the other, glancing round.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, you may talk here,” said
Fletcher testily.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, you remember that I told you that
when I heard that Mr. Halley speaking it
reminded me of something. I have been worrying
over it, and it has all come back to me now. I
am quite certain that it was he who was in the
room with Lord Reckavile when he was
murdered. It was his voice we heard. It came
through two doors and was muffled, but there is
no mistaking his tone.”</p>

<p>Fletcher started back; here was news indeed.</p>

<p>“Are you absolutely certain, Brown?” he said
“remember this is of the very utmost importance,
you must not make a mistake.”</p>

<p>“I am certain,” said the constable doggedly.</p>

<p>“And I’ll tell you another thing, sir, when I
found those two men in the library, although I
only had a glimpse, I am nearly positive one of
them was Halley.”</p>

<p>“Can you swear to that?” said Fletcher
gripping the other’s arm in his excitement.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I can’t swear to that, only in my
own mind I am pretty sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have something to go upon at last,”
said Fletcher. “Not a word of this to anyone.
We must get some more details. I knew that
fellow with his superior manners and
hypocritical ways was a crook, though why he should
make love to a penniless girl like Ena Sefton, is
beyond me.”</p>

<p>But if he had hit at last on the real criminal,
there was something still hidden. What could
be more stupid than for a man to commit a
murder, and then remain on in the village for no
reason, unless …</p>

<p>He recalled to his mind cases where men who
had fallen in love had committed every kind of
indiscretion and jeopardised their safety. He
had on his journeyings visited the Castle of Blois,
and seen the spot where the Duc de Guise had
stood eating prunes, while waiting for the
summons of the King which had been a call to death,
and all because in spite of warnings, he had
remained on, in attendance on his mistress.</p>

<p>Giles, when he was examined was less sure
than the constable.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t be sartin’,” he kept on repeating,
“I were that flustered, and I be ’ard of ’earing.
No I dun’no as ’ow I cud swear to any voice for
sartin’.”</p>

<p>Fletcher was cute enough to see that such
evidence was worthless, and that the stubborn old
man would not alter his evidence in the Box.</p>

<p>But a startling new piece of information came
to hand by accident, when he returned to the
Club, and fell into conversation with the steward.</p>

<p>Their talk turned on Sefton, and the mystery
which was no longer a mystery.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the steward, “I knew he was a
doctor. He brought a gentleman in here
sometime ago, who was bleeding like a stuck pig. I
held the basin for him, and the way he bound him
up showed me he had some experience.”</p>

<p>“When was this?” said Fletcher without
suspecting anything important. The other laughed;
“I can easily tell you that,” said he “it was the
night the murder took place at the castle.”</p>

<p>“What?” said Fletcher “and who was the
man?”</p>

<p>“That I can’t tell you for certain. He was on
a seat outside the Club, and the night was dark.
Mr. Sefton thought he had fallen down and cut
himself. I thought it was just a case of
drunkenness. I believe it was Mr. Halley who’s staying
in the village.”</p>

<p>There was only one thing to do, although
Fletcher knew he would not meet with a genial
reception from Sefton.</p>

<p>He made his way to his bungalow, and asked
for him. The tousled maid who did odd jobs,
and did them mighty badly, informed him that
the “Doctor,” as she called him, was in, but Miss
Sefton was out, at which Fletcher was rather
relieved.</p>

<p>Sefton came to the door and eyed his visitor
with little favour.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sefton,” said the Detective formally “I
would not come to you if it was not on a matter
of great importance, but I believe you can give
me some information.”</p>

<p>“What is it now?” said Sefton.</p>

<p>“On the night of the murder, I understand
you bound up a man who was wounded or
injured in some way, at the Club. Would you
mind telling me who that was?”</p>

<p>“Really, Fletcher,” said Sefton “you have a
lot to learn in your profession. Your questions
are very crude. If I treat a man medically I
no more disclose his name than a priest does one
who comes to confession.”</p>

<p>His manner annoyed Fletcher.</p>

<p>“That’s all nonsense,” he said “you are not a
real doctor and in any case in the interests of
justice …”</p>

<p>Sefton cut him short.</p>

<p>“The interests of justice are concerned with
criminals, and as the man in question had
nothing to do with the crime, there is no reason
to reveal his name. You will excuse me, but I
am rather busy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I know why you refuse,” said
Fletcher “because it was that fellow Halley. I
believe you are all conspiring together to shield
him but I’ll …”</p>

<p>Fletcher was left to face a closed door, and
turned away with death in his heart. Were the
whole village in league to cheat the ends of
justice?</p>

<p>In a furious mood he made his way to the
telephone to call up Sergeant Andrews.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch113">

<h2>Chapter XIII. <br> Detained on Suspicion</h2>

<p>“Mr. Halley, will you accompany us to
Ashstead, I have a car outside; you will
probably know why we have come.”</p>

<p>It was Sergeant Andrews who spoke these
ominous words. By his side was Fletcher with
a smile of triumph on his face. He had run his
enemy to earth at last, and even though he might
be treated with scorn by Ena, what would be her
opinion of his rival? There was a tense silence;
Halley stood motionless, not a muscle moved.
Fletcher with deliberate cruelty had staged this
scene at the Sefton’s Bungalow.</p>

<p>“As you are police officers, I suppose I may
take it that you suspect me of some crime,” said
Halley calmly.</p>

<p>“We wish to ask you some questions with
regard to the murder of Lord Reckavile, and these
are better dealt with by the proper authorities,”
said Andrews, who disliked his task.</p>

<p>“I will come with you,” said Halley. “Am I
to be handcuffed or anything of that sort?”
There was irony in his tone which was galling to
Fletcher.</p>

<p>“Not at present,” he said sharply.</p>

<p>Before another word could be said there was a
cry, a door was flung open, and Ena came into
the room. Her eyes were blazing with anger, as
she walked straight across to Halley and stood
by his side.</p>

<p>“What was this I heard,” she said “Police!
Arrest! They must be mad.”</p>

<p>“We shall see about that,” said Fletcher,
“when your precious friend is in the Dock.”</p>

<p>“It is untrue,” she said. “Tell them that it is
utterly false.” In spite of her complete trust in
him there was a terrible lurking suspicion at the
back of her mind. She knew that he was not a
murderer, but the facts that had leaked out from
her brother’s statement, that a struggle had
taken place at the castle might mean that he had
acted in self-defence, but surely not with a knife,
she could not believe that he would, even in
anger, deal so cowardly a blow.</p>

<p>Halley spoke.</p>

<p>“Miss Sefton,” he said, “to these police officers
I would have said nothing, but since you have
asked me, I can tell you that I did not commit
this crime.” Fletcher gave a contemptuous laugh,
which made even Sergeant Andrews look at him
in reproof—it was unprofessional.</p>

<p>Halley continued calmly. “What is more to
the point is that I can easily prove my
innocence.”</p>

<p>Her faced cleared. “I knew there must be
some terrible mistake,” she said.</p>

<p>Sergeant Andrews felt the conversation had
gone far enough.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry, Miss Sefton, that you were
here at all. Mr. Fletcher told me that you were
not at home, and that we merely came for Mr.
Halley. I had just driven to fetch him, so we
had better get off.”</p>

<p>Ena came to the door, her face was white, but
she had a look of pride and confidence.</p>

<p>“Come back to us soon,” she said, “you will
receive a warm welcome,” and she glanced a look
of hatred and contempt at Fletcher.</p>

<p>“Do not worry about me, it will only be a
matter of a few hours,” Halley said as the car drove
off.</p>

<p>The examination was short, but Halley for the
first time felt the indignity of his position, for
the surroundings in which he found himself were
enough to disgust any man of decent breeding.</p>

<p>The police at the station pushed him along as
though he had been caught in the act of stealing
a purse or cutting a throat. He realised how
utterly futile is the old adage that a man under
British Law is considered innocent until he is
proved guilty.</p>

<p>The short sharp questions of the Inspector
grated on him, and behind it all was the vision of
one young girl torn with anxiety and waiting to
know the issue of this day’s business.</p>

<p>His pride would have made him keep silent,
but the image ever before him forced him to
speak.</p>

<p>“If I studied my own interests,” he said “I
would let you go on with this absurd charge, and
burn your fingers over the matter. If you are
wise you will let me clear myself immediately.
The murder of which you accuse me took place
on the 20th of January and on that night I have
at least three witnesses who can testify that I was
with them during the entire evening, and
therefore could not have been at Reckavile Castle.”</p>

<p>The firmness of his tone and the quiet manner
in which he spoke disconcerted the Inspector, and
he turned to Fletcher for advice.</p>

<p>“I have evidence,” said Fletcher “of the most
compromising character, and in spite of what
this man says I would strongly advise that he be
detained, and brought before the Magistrates,
where the whole matter can be gone into. I may
add,” he said with meaning, “that I represent
Scotland Yard in this matter.”</p>

<p>The Inspector was at a loss as to what to do;
on the one hand he had a heavy respect for
the Yard; on the other Halley’s manner had
impressed him.</p>

<p>“Who are your witnesses?” he asked Halley.</p>

<p>“If you care to send for a certain Mr.
Southgate of the <i>Black Horse</i> at Portham Village and
his wife, they will both confirm what I have said.
And there is a fisherman who also saw me there
on that night. I merely say this in your own
interests,” he added “for it does not bring the
police force into good repute when they make
wrongful arrests.”</p>

<p>The Inspector scratched his head in
perplexity.</p>

<p>“I think, Mr. Fletcher,” he said “we had
better either send for these witnesses, or wire for
instructions from Scotland Yard.”</p>

<p>For the first time, serious doubts crossed
Fletcher’s mind and he addressed Halley in a
more conciliatory tone.</p>

<p>“But if you can prove an alibi, can you account
for the fact that Brown is willing to swear an
oath that it was you who were talking with Lord
Reckavile immediately before his murder.”</p>

<p>Halley shrugged his shoulders. “It is not for
me to prove my innocence,” he said, “but for
you to prove my guilt. I am always to be found,
I do not intend to run away, but you must have
better evidence than you have at present before
you can prove your case.”</p>

<p>“I think on the whole,” said the Inspector, “we
had better send for these people.”</p>

<p>Fletcher remained silent, and the Inspector
took this for acquiescence. He rang his bell, and
an officer appeared.</p>

<p>“Tell Sergeant Andrews,” he said “to motor
in at once and bring out the landlord of the <i>Black
Horse</i>, and his wife, and get the name of the
fisherman whom Mr. Halley says was with him on
the night of the murder.”</p>

<p>The officer saluted and went out.</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause. The Inspector
had not any special liking for the interference of
Scotland Yard, and was rather pleased with the
prospect of proving their envoy in the wrong.</p>

<p>“Can you help us to throw any light whatever
on this mysterious matter?” he said to Halley.</p>

<p>“I could say a good deal,” said Halley, “but
while I am an accused person I refuse to make
any statement whatever.”</p>

<p>“Then I may take it that you have information
which might lead to the detection of the criminal
and are deliberately withholding it?”</p>

<p>“Which criminal?” said Halley.</p>

<p>The Inspector gave an impatient gesture.
“You know what I mean, the murderer of Lord
Reckavile.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I understand, I thought you meant the
other.”</p>

<p>“Are you talking in riddles to amuse
yourself?”</p>

<p>Halley shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps you
will learn the answer some day.”</p>

<p>After a wait of half an hour, Sergeant
Andrews arrived in the car accompanied by
Southgate, his wife and a fisherman. There was a look
of vexation on the Sergeant’s face.</p>

<p>“I am afraid there is something wrong, sir,”
he said to the Inspector. “It appears that on the
night when the murder took place, Mr. Halley
was at the <i>Black Horse</i> with Southgate and his
wife, and was also seen by a considerable number
of other people. I would not trust the landlord
much myself, but the evidence of an alibi is
overwhelming.”</p>

<p>Fletcher intervened. “There are certain
movements of Southgate’s which require explanation.
He had a habit of going out at night on the
excuse of fishing, when it is impossible for anyone
to put a boat to sea.”</p>

<p>The landlord grinned broadly. “I am afraid
this gentleman suffers from nerves. ’E was very
scared when ’e stopped at my poor place.”</p>

<p>When all the evidence had been heard, there
was only one thing to do; Halley was released
with profuse apologies from the Inspector, and
was sent off in the same car in which he had been
brought in as a suspected person. The police
officers stared blankly at each other.</p>

<p>The Inspector was a man of few words.</p>

<p>“You have made a pretty mess of things,” he
said to Fletcher, “I should think Scotland Yard
will be rather pleased.”</p>

<p>Fletcher flushed angrily.</p>

<p>“If all the information that your police officers
give me is as accurate as what I have just had, I
do not think much of their efficiency.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is no good quarrelling,” said the other
“you have tried to pin the crime on to young
Sefton, on to Mr. Halley and now I can see you
suspect Southgate, though he also has a complete
alibi. Who is going to be your next victim?”</p>

<p>Halley got out of the car before he reached
Portham, and walked slowly to the Sefton
bungalow. Sefton was at <i>The Red Cote</i>, where he
worked all day, and Halley knew that Ena
would be alone and anxious. He softly
approached the house and walked in without
knocking, as he had been accustomed to do for some
time. There were no signs of the girl in the
lounge, and he tapped softly on her door.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” a muffled voice replied.</p>

<p>“It is I, Halley,” he said.</p>

<p>There was a sharp cry from within, and Ena
came out; her face showed signs that she had
been crying, and she had a strained look, but she
came forward with a glad welcome and took both
his hands in a frank open manner.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad you are back,” she said “I
know it was all a mistake, but how terrible it has
been for you.”</p>

<p>He did not let go of her hands, but said
quietly:</p>

<p>“And for you too?”</p>

<p>She looked down now and murmured. “The
most terrible time of my life.”</p>

<p>“Ena,” he said, and she did not resent the use
of her Christian name, “even you were not quite
sure of my innocence; I could see it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t think that,” she replied “it is not
true, I knew you had never committed a murder,
but I thought …” and she stopped.</p>

<p>“What was it you thought?” he said almost
sternly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know what my brother says about
the struggle in the room, and that Lord
Reckavile must have struck his assailant, and the words
he said suggested a quarrel. I thought perhaps
he might have assaulted you.”</p>

<p>“And that I had stuck a knife into him,” he
said sadly.</p>

<p>“Oh. No! No! I knew you could not have
done that.”</p>

<p>A sudden look of amazement came into
Halley’s face.</p>

<p>“My God,” he said “I think I can see light,
but if so how devilish! How fiendishly
cunning!”</p>

<p>She was startled and tried to release her hands,
but he led her gently to a seat and sat beside her.</p>

<p>“Let us forget this horrible business if we can.
I want to tell you something. There is a
mystery in my life, which I cannot explain even to
you at present. Some day perhaps I may be able
to do so. This alone has prevented me from
saying something to you which has been burning
into my head since first I saw you.”</p>

<p>Ena gave him a quick glance, and then looked
down.</p>

<p>“I think you can guess what it is, and if you
have nothing to say to me, I will walk out of this
room and out of your life sooner than hurt your
feelings. When first I met you on that windy
afternoon, when you were battling against the
storm so bravely, and I learned that this was the
symbol of your life—battling against the Storm,
my heart went out to you in sympathy such as I
have never felt to anyone else in the world, and
during those following days, when your sweet
companionship meant so much to me—more than
you perhaps will ever know—I knew that for the
first time in my life I loved, and would go on
loving for all time, whether you cared for me or
not.”</p>

<p>His voice was very tender.</p>

<p>“Love I take it,” he said “is sacrifice and
service. My whole mind and body has been in your
service and yours only since first we met, and if
my life could have been given to lift the burden,
which I saw was hanging over you, I would
willingly have made the sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“I know,” she said softly, and tears were
falling unrestrainedly and she made no effort to
wipe them from her face.</p>

<p>He waited for a moment and then continued.</p>

<p>“It is possible that I have hurt you by what I
have said. I will not insult you with the usual
question as to whether there is someone else to
whom you have already given your heart, nor
will I ask you for an answer now.”</p>

<p>Then she looked up at last.</p>

<p>“Surely you men must be completely blind. I
think you are the only one of our acquaintances
who has not seen the truth that I have loved you
all the time.”</p>

<p>With a great sigh he gathered her into his
arms. She nestled her head on his shoulder and
with a happy laugh said,</p>

<p>“If you had not spoken to me, I think I should
have to have spoken to you. My brother has
been constantly warning me that I am throwing
myself away on you. Fletcher taunted me with
the same thing, and I am sure all those police
constables must have seen the state of things
to-day, when I gave myself away completely.”</p>

<p>His manner was gay, in contrast to his usual
gravity.</p>

<p>“Well you have given yourself away now
completely, I hope. Come, let’s walk to <i>The Red
Cote</i>, and tell your brother.”</p>

<p>With a happy smile, she took his hand and
they went out together.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV. <br> A Vision of the Night</h2>

<p>The news that Halley and Ena were
engaged was the last straw to Fletcher. One
thing was now firm in his mind, to find out the
truth of the whole matter, and not to fail in this
at any rate, for failure was intolerable after all
the indignities he had suffered.</p>

<p>In spite of his common-sense mind, he began
to have a feeling that something not altogether
natural had played a hand in the affair.</p>

<p>There was the mysterious “Other Man” who
obtruded himself at every turn, elusive and
vague, but always felt.</p>

<p>The man who had talked with Reckavile, and
whose voice Brown had sworn was Halley’s.
The man who had been in the library with one
who, he was morally certain, was Southgate.
The one who had appeared to him in the library
under such strange circumstances, and the man
with a bleeding wound who had been bandaged
up by Sefton.</p>

<p>At every turn he was met by this mysterious
individual. Was there anything in this Curse
theory after all? Surely we had outgrown these
ideas!</p>

<p>There was only one thing to do; for some
unexplained reason attempts had been made to get
into the library after the murder. What was the
object? And had that object been accomplished?</p>

<p>The queer old man, the memory of whom sent
a cold shudder down his back, had done nothing,
and the supposed burglars had been disturbed,
but had they tried to come again?</p>

<p>Here was evidently the key to the mystery.</p>

<p>Fletcher made up his mind that he would
spend his nights in the room, and stake all on this
chance.</p>

<p>For nights he watched, a tortured man. He
sat in the dark, and tried to reconstruct the scene.
Here was Lord Reckavile talking to—someone.
Then there was a sudden attack—but by whom?
Reckavile or the other. By the evidence
Reckavile was the aggressor, but nothing could alter
the fact that a knife was sticking in his ribs.</p>

<p>His mind turned in a curious way to the round
leather object found on the dead man. What
was it, and had it any bearing on the crime?</p>

<p>There were signs of the coming dawn, and a
very dim light was filtering into the room, for the
blinds were not drawn, when very faintly a slight
jarring noise came to his ears; someone was
approaching through the Hall. He silently slid
behind the sofa, and lay there clutching the
powerful electric torch which he had brought
with him. The sounds grew louder and there
was a creak of a board, then he heard a whisper
which told him that more than one person was
approaching. His senses were strained to catch
the slightest indication as to who the visitors
might be. He was convinced now that they were
standing close to him. He could hear rapid
breathing, but no other sound broke the silence.
Now was the time for action. This time he had
come armed, and holding his revolver in the right
hand, he rose to his feet and switched on the
torch.</p>

<p>Utter amazement kept him spellbound. Close
to the old desk, and bending over it were two
men, who rose and faced him at the sudden flood
of light. The one was his mysterious visitor, the
old man who had appeared before, but strange as
this was, the sight of the other is what filled him
with astonishment, for this was no other than
Sinclair, his own Chief at Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked Sinclair shading his eyes
from the glare of the torch.</p>

<p>Fletcher advanced. “I am Fletcher, sir. But
what on earth are you doing here?”</p>

<p>With all his sense of respect, there was a note
of suspicion in his voice, at which Sinclair
laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Oh! we are not committing a burglary,” he
said “but as things were hanging fire, I thought
I had better come down and have a look at
matters for myself.”</p>

<p>“And may I ask,” said Fletcher rather
annoyed that his Chief had come without
informing him, “who is that with you?”</p>

<p>The old detective seemed to hesitate for a
moment.</p>

<p>“Giles I be,” said the old man, with a senile
chuckle, and Fletcher recalled that he had used
exactly the same words on the former occasion.
Was the place really haunted, and were these
two figments of his own brain?</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me that you were coming
down, sir?” he said to Sinclair.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, I did not know myself
until this afternoon, but something has happened
which led me to intervene in the case. I was
pretty certain of the true solution from the very
first.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t understand even now. You
say you are not committing a burglary, sir,” said
Fletcher, and stopped.</p>

<p>The old man drew himself up with some
dignity, and said in a very different voice.</p>

<p>“As the castle belongs to me I do not think we
need discuss that; if anyone is unlawfully
intruding, it is you.”</p>

<p>He turned on an electric lamp, though the
dawn shed a ghostly light into the room.</p>

<p>Sinclair broke the silence.</p>

<p>“I think we had better have a round-table
conference. We wanted to make the final discovery
first, but as things have gone so far, we had
better have all the cards on the table.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand,” said Fletcher “if
you know everything, who was the murderer,
and who is this—gentleman?”</p>

<p>“As to the first question,” said Sinclair
impatiently, “there is no doubt about that, and as to
the other, you shall know. Now go off, and ask
these people to come here at ten o’clock
punctually. Remember, you have not done too well
in this case, so I rely on you to carry out these
instructions. You will ’phone for Sergeant
Andrews and Brown. Use my name. Then you
must get Southgate and Giles, and Mr. Sefton
and his sister.” He looked at the old man, who
nodded.</p>

<p>“Giles must come and tidy the place a bit and
arrange a conference room. Everything hangs
on that. Don’t forget. At ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>Fletcher went out like a man in a dream:
What on earth was the meaning of it all? Even
now he was as much in the dark as ever. Why
this conference and who among those invited was
the murderer? Also why had the very man of
all others whom he suspected still, Halley, been
omitted. Or, stay, was it because Sinclair had
already got Halley? The thought thrilled him.</p>

<p>At any rate he had a job of work to do.</p>

<p>Thanks to old Giles’ efforts the library was
transformed when the strange party began to
arrive, and it looked more like a Board Room,
with a large table and chairs set round it.</p>

<p>The police representatives were the first to
arrive, as nonplussed as Fletcher, and feeling
rather aggrieved that such a man as Sinclair
should have acted without telling them anything.</p>

<p>This drew them together, and Fletcher,
Andrews and Brown seated themselves at one end
of the table, and waited. Jack Sefton and his
sister came next, the latter nervous and rather
pale. She gave a formal bow to the other men
and with her brother took the opposite end of the
long table.</p>

<p>The genial Southgate, who had obviously
prepared himself for the meeting with refreshment
from his cellar, entered and greeted the others
with a cheery good morning. He looked at
Fletcher, and laughed.</p>

<p>“Young man,” he said “you’ll ’ave a ’igh old
time in a moment,” and he slapped his leg.</p>

<p>Giles had been hovering about, making things
comfortable, and was quite the old butler again,
but all waited for the principal figure. It seemed
as though the whole thing had been staged for
effect.</p>

<p>The door opened and Sinclair entered
accompanied by the old man whom Fletcher had seen,
and they took their seats in astonished silence.</p>

<p>There was one vacant chair, which Fletcher
supposed was reserved for Halley.</p>

<p>“He’s late,” said Sinclair looking at his watch.</p>

<p>“I think I hear someone, sir,” said Giles,
going to the door.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cook,” Giles announced, and the house
agent came in and smiled nervously at the
company.</p>

<p>“Take a seat, Mr. Cook,” said Sinclair. “Now
I think we are all here. We are going to piece
together this mystery.”</p>

<p>The others looked at the house agent in
astonishment. What was he doing in this gathering?
Their speculations were interrupted by Sinclair
who spoke slowly and with a solemn tone in his
voice.</p>

<p>“This has been a problem of some difficulty
and I am not going to disguise the fact that at
one time it nearly baffled the authorities. Now
it is quite clear.”</p>

<p>“It may be to you, sir,” said Fletcher “but to
me it is as dark as ever.”</p>

<p>A flicker of a smile came to Sinclair’s grim
face.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would like to ask a question or
two?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Who was talking with Lord Reckavile in
this room when the murder took place?” said
Fletcher.</p>

<p>“No one, at least no living thing.”</p>

<p>“How did the other man escape from the
room?”</p>

<p>“He did not escape, there was no other man.”</p>

<p>“Had the Reckavile Curse anything to do with
the crime?”</p>

<p>“Yes, everything.”</p>

<p>“Did it kill him?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sinclair solemnly.</p>

<p>“This is absurd,” said Fletcher impatiently,
“I don’t believe in bogies.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Sinclair imperturbably.</p>

<p>“I suppose you will say Lord Reckavile
committed suicide?”</p>

<p>“In one sense, yes.”</p>

<p>“Then he was not murdered?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes he was, and …” Sinclair leaned
forward in his chair and said slowly: “The
murderer is in the room at the present moment.”</p>

<p>There was utter silence, except for the
breathing of those present. The room seemed to grow
dark, and the air became oppressive. Those
round the table looked at each other with horror
and suspicion in their eyes, and a vague shadowy
something seemed to be gathering in the room.</p>

<p>Ena shuddered. Where was her lover? Why
was he not there of all people, when he had
actually been accused of the crime?</p>

<p>Was there something in the Curse after all,
and some unseen visitant hovering about them?</p>

<p>She could bear it no longer, and in a strained
voice asked:</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Halley, Mr. Sinclair, and why
is he not here?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Halley does not exist,” then hastily as
he saw the girl’s face. “Don’t be alarmed, Miss
Sefton, he never did exist.”</p>

<p>Doubts as to Sinclair’s sanity began to fill the
minds of the others.</p>

<p>“But why all this mystery, sir? If you know
all about it, why not tell us?” asked Fletcher.</p>

<p>“I did not say I knew <em>all</em> about it. Well as no
one seems disposed to speak, we had better get
on with the story, eh Lord Reckavile?” He
turned to the old man beside him.</p>

<p>An exclamation of astonishment, mixed with
superstitious terror came to those present. Giles
reeled and turned ashen, while the breath
soughed between his teeth, and his eyes bulged
from his head. He was standing behind the old
man. Sinclair saw him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am sorry Giles, you should not have
been standing, come and sit down, no I insist, it
was too bad keeping you standing all this time,”
and he conducted the old servant to a chair.
“Are you feeling better now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you, sir,” he answered faintly.</p>

<p>The strange old man addressed as Lord
Reckavile deliberately took hold of his hair and beard
and removed them disclosing the face of Halley,
looking grotesque enough with patches of grease
paint where the hair had not covered his face,
and white eyebrows which he pulled off with
difficulty.</p>

<p>“Well I’m damned,” said Fletcher and hastily
apologised to Ena.</p>

<p>“I give it up,” said Sefton.</p>

<p>Ena’s eyes were fixed on Halley. An awful
suspicion was gathering in her mind that he too
was a detective in disguise and had been acting
a part, perhaps with her, but she dismissed it as
unworthy.</p>

<p>Sinclair was speaking. “I had hoped for a
final link in the chain, but since we have not got
it I am going to ask Lord Reckavile to tell us
his story. It is a long one, but you will find it
interesting I think.”</p>

<p>“Lord Reckavile …?” began Fletcher.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Sinclair “you shall know the
truth now.”</p>

<h2>Book II. <br> The Reckaviles</h2>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch201">

<h2>Chapter I. <br> The Convent School</h2>

<p>A great Cathedral Church rises high over
the river, a beautiful landmark for miles
round. It is not an old Gothic church, for these
passed into the hands of the Anglicans at the
Reformation, but is a model of modern Gothic,
stately and tall, with stained glass windows
between the slender buttresses.</p>

<p>Below nestles the little town, terraced on the
slope above the marshland where a sluggish river
winds to the sea.</p>

<p>Here in this quiet world a convent school was
bedded in the woods, where the patient nuns
devoted their lives to the education of all—whether
of their own religion or not—who came under
their charge.</p>

<p>On a summer day nearly half a century ago,
there came to the convent school an Italian lady,
with a young girl, fresh as a rose bud, half
formed, but giving promise of rare beauty.</p>

<p>The mother was past her first youth, and like
so many southerners was showing signs of fading
charms, but still dangerously beautiful.</p>

<p>The child, who spoke no English, gazed shyly
round, as they were admitted through the gates
to the lovely garden within, and into a cool large
room, there to await the Mother Superior.</p>

<p>The woman was dressed in excellent taste, the
only jarring note being the quantity of jewelry
she wore, which betrayed a certain vulgarity in
her otherwise faultless appearance.</p>

<p>The Mother Superior entered with a calm and
sweet face as of one whose life was one long
sacrifice.</p>

<p>“I wish to leave my little daughter Carlotta
with you,” said the Italian. “She is fourteen
years old, and has been educated in Verona, but
circumstances have arisen which render it
necessary for me to part with her—for a time at any
rate.”</p>

<p>The Mother Superior bowed and waited.
Although shut up in seclusion she knew the world,
and was a shrewd judge of its people.</p>

<p>“Her father is dead,” said the other, in a
careless voice and crossed herself. “And I am about
to marry a very dear friend, Count —, but
perhaps I had better leave the name unsaid.</p>

<p>“He has known me for many years, and at last
I have agreed to yield to his appeal.” She shook
out a fold of her cloak, and looked at the other.</p>

<p>A grim look came to the eyes of the Mother
Superior, seldom seen there, as she said. “And
so the little one is to be left in our care? And is
she to remain in our charge during the holidays?
It is far to go to Italy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would be better. You see Marco does
not care for her to be at home, when we are first
married, and I—well, it reminds me of
advancing years,” and she gave a hard laugh.</p>

<p>“I understand,” said the Mother Superior,
then “poor child. She has been confirmed?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I have the certificate here,” and she
opened her bag.</p>

<p>“And her birth certificate? That may be
necessary for examinations.”</p>

<p>“No, I am afraid I have not got that. I lost
it—I did not think it would be necessary.” She
hesitated.</p>

<p>“I think I understand,” said the other looking
straight at her.</p>

<p>“Our fold is open to all, especially to those
children—without birth certificates.”</p>

<p>“The fees shall be paid regularly,” the Italian
went on hastily. “Marco is very rich, and will
grudge nothing, you need have no anxiety.”</p>

<p>The conversation had gone on in English of
which Carlotta understood no word, but looked
questioningly at each in turn, clinging shyly to
her mother.</p>

<p>When the time for parting came, she cried
bitterly, silently.</p>

<p>Her mother gave her a formal kiss, and told
her to behave well in her new school. She would
write to her, she said, and perhaps come and see
her next year. Meanwhile the Sisters would look
after her.</p>

<p>And so she took her departure, impatient to be
gone, and would not even stay for food which
was offered her.</p>

<p>“Poor lamb,” said the Mother Superior, and
brought her to the Sisters. She handed her over
to Sister Ursula, who was versed in these cases,
who soon had Carlotta smiling, and in a few days
her troubles were almost forgotten. Life was
fair, and the English June beautiful as a picture.
Roses were out in the gardens, the trees were
in fresh green, and the flowers along the old wall
were such as she had never seen. The Sisters
were particularly kind to Carlotta; she was so
fragile, with an exotic prettiness, given to sudden
crying at times. And there was a wistful look in
her eyes, as though gazing out over the sea to her
southern home. She had beautiful dark eyes,
with long lashes, was grave and composed at her
lessons, and attentive in the dim chapel, where
she would kneel with a devotion beyond her
years, at the wonderful services, her eyes fixed as
though in ecstasy.</p>

<p>But she was happiest in the Chapel of Our
Lady, where she would adore with clasped hands.
The Mother Superior was disturbed, she did not
like to see too much fervour in one so young.
She knew the reactions which so often come later.</p>

<p>“It is all so beautiful,” Carlotta said to Sister
Ursula. “When I grow up I shall be a sister.
Do you think they will let me or am I too
wicked?”</p>

<p>The Sister smiled and stroked her black hair.
“My dear, we must do as Our Blessed Lady
directs,” she said, “we can seldom choose for
ourselves. To some is given the quiet and holiness
of a religious life, but others are called to go out
into the world, and to face the evil there—perhaps
to marry.”</p>

<p>A far away look came into her eyes, and a sigh
escaped her.</p>

<p>Carlotta did not see it; she rose and stamped
her little foot. “I shall never marry,” she cried
with passion “Never! Never!”</p>

<p>“Hush, my child, you must not speak like
that,” but she folded her in her arms.</p>

<p>Of her mother Carlotta never spoke, and the
promised letters never came. The fees were paid
regularly for a year, but there was no mention of
a visit from her mother, and then came silence,
and when a letter was sent to her address, it was
returned, undelivered. The Mother Superior
sent for Ursula, and showed it to her without
comment.</p>

<p>“But you will not send her away?” she cried
in alarm.</p>

<p>The other was grave, but she smiled as she
said. “I expected this, the so-called Count has
got tired of her. We shall hear no more of them,
but this sweet child, no, she shall remain with us.
She must not be told. Mother Church does not
cast out her children.”</p>

<p>And so another year passed, and the promise
of the bud was revealed in the flower. Carlotta
ripened early as southerners do, and at sixteen
would have lured St. Anthony from his
devotions. Black curls fell round her sweet face, and
the great, dark, innocent eyes, wondrous as the
mirror of the sea, in their changeful emotions,
looked out on the world fearless yet timid,
dreaming of what lay in the glory of the future.</p>

<p>Her figure was straight and supple, like one of
the flowers in the garden she loved so
passionately.</p>

<p>Ursula was anxious. The child had fits of
silence, when she would get away from the
others, and sit motionless in the garden.</p>

<p>With the other girls she was a favourite, for
though she did not excel either at work or games,
she was always kind and gentle, and took keen
delight in the success of others.</p>

<p>The early summer had come which was
Carlotta’s happiest time, for she pined in the winter.</p>

<p>The girls were allowed in the woods with the
Sisters, and Carlotta loved the green and
fragrant hollows where the bluebells made a carpet,
and the birds sang for joy.</p>

<p>One day she had wandered off by herself, for
she was allowed a certain freedom, on account of
her queer moods, and the others were not far off.</p>

<p>She was aroused from her dreaming by the
sound of a voice.</p>

<p>“What a face to paint! Ye gods! I’ve never
seen so perfect a picture.”</p>

<p>She looked up in alarm and saw a young man
standing before her. In her secluded life she had
spoken to no men save the old priest who heard
her blameless confessions. This one was tall and
clean, and the face was moulded like one of the
old Greek gods.</p>

<p>Had she known more of the world she would
have seen a restless hungry look in the eyes, but
at present they were filled with the light of
admiration.</p>

<p>“Who are you, little goddess?” he asked in a
musical voice. “And what do you among these
woods? Perchance you are an Oread strayed
from your home.”</p>

<p>Carlotta was unafraid, and replied innocently.</p>

<p>“I am at the convent school, The Convent of
the Sacred Heart, and the others are near here,
but I came to hear the birds, they sing so
sweetly.”</p>

<p>“And what do they tell you, little Daphne?”</p>

<p>“They sing of something I cannot
understand,” she said with a smile, “but it is very
beautiful.”</p>

<p>The man laughed outright. “What a quaint
little girl you are. Shall I tell you what they
sing about? It is Love. They are telling each
other how much they love, and that all should
love on such days as this.” He stretched his
hands out to the sky.</p>

<p>Carlotta suddenly remembered herself.</p>

<p>“I must not talk to you,” she said “it is
forbidden. I must go and find the others. Sister
Ursula would be very angry if she knew I had
been talking to a man.”</p>

<p>The man smiled. “And is a man so very
dreadful?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are taught that they are
terrible creatures, ogres who are waiting to eat little
girls.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said “I have never spoken
to one before,” and she opened wide her great
eyes.</p>

<p>“I must not keep you,” said the man. “I am
a painter, I won’t say artist, and when I saw
you, I thought what a beautiful picture I could
make of you, for a Madonna.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush!” said Carlotta shocked. “I, as a
picture of Our Blessed Lady, I must not listen,”
and she rose in haste.</p>

<p>“What a funny little girl you are,” he said,
laying a hand on her arm. “We always have to
use models; all artists have, even for the Christ
or the Blessed Virgin; there is nothing wicked
in that.”</p>

<p>She looked at him doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well if you must go, tell me when I can see
you again,” he said. “You’ve haven’t told me
your name yet?”</p>

<p>“My name is Carlotta, but they call me
Carlot,” she said.</p>

<p>“Carlot! That’s the name of my dog,” and he
laughed boisterously.</p>

<p>Carlotta was hurt. “That is not kind of you,”
she said and turned to go.</p>

<p>“One moment. I am sorry, but so sweet a face
deserves a better name. I shall call you Daphne.
When can we meet?”</p>

<p>For the first time she was alarmed. Sitting on
the ground was one thing, but standing beside
him and seeing how tall and strong he was, she
felt a vague fear.</p>

<p>“Carlot … Carlot … where are you?”
came a call.</p>

<p>A sudden realisation of her wickedness in
talking to a man came to her, and she turned and
fled away.</p>

<p>He did not try to detain her.</p>

<p>“What a sweet face. What lovely eyes,” he
said, and the sight of her little breast rising and
falling with emotion as she spoke, appealed to
more than the artist in him.</p>

<p>“Now which is it?” he said aloud. “You
blackguard, is this going to be a dream to think of and
something on the credit side, or a mere
seduction? You devil, I never know which way the
balance will turn.”</p>

<p>He went slowly into the town, the vision with
him all the way.</p>

<p>“Mr. Desmond, there is a Mrs. Wheatland to
see you,” said the head waiter deferentially.</p>

<p>“Oh! Damn!” said he, “that spoils the vision
beautiful. All right, show her to my sitting
room.”</p>

<p>A young woman was ushered in, with a
fascinating rather than pretty face, one who, a keen
judge would have said, would not stand the wear
and tear of life for long. The hands and feet
were large, and though at present she was in the
glory of early womanhood, there were
unmistakable signs of latent vulgarity.</p>

<p>She came forward at once, and flung her arms
round the man’s neck, and almost smothered him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hugh! I have found you at last. Where
have you been all this time? I have been longing
for you. And my husband is getting worse than
ever. I could just bear with him until I met you,
but since then everything has been so different,
and he is so common, so plebeian. But what is
the matter, dear? You don’t seem glad to see
me?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am, Winnie, but you have taken
me by surprise,” he said disengaging himself.
“I am delighted to see you, but you know it is
dangerous coming here.”</p>

<p>“You need not be afraid,” she answered in a
tone almost of contempt. “My husband is in
Germany buying goods, or something of that
sort—I don’t understand trade—and he will be
away a fortnight.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that’s all right, let’s have something
to eat.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, you don’t seem
a bit pleased to see me?” she said petulantly.
Desmond roused himself; the vision was still with
him, but here was something more tangible.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, dear, I have been having a long
walk in the woods, and I got tired. When we
have had a decent dinner and a bottle of the best
we can talk over things.”</p>

<p>She looked at him doubtfully for a moment,
and then said:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would rather I went?”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Of course not. It is delightful
seeing you. Come on, go and get dressed, I
suppose you have brought your things?”</p>

<p>“I left my bag at the station, as I was not
certain you were here. Shall I send for it?”</p>

<p>For the moment he hesitated. “Yes, of course.
I will tell the waiter. But you gave your name
as Mrs. Wheatland?”</p>

<p>“Never mind.”</p>

<p>Desmond rang the bell.</p>

<p>“Have Mrs. Wheatland’s bag fetched. Here
is the ticket, and reserve a room for her,” he said
in a tone used to command.</p>

<p>When he saw her enter the dining room he was
thrilled.</p>

<p>She was certainly a very beautiful woman, he
thought, and after all one must have some fun
out of life.</p>

<p>Her evening gown was not lacking in
scantiness, and displayed as much of her body as could
reasonably be expected in those austere times.</p>

<p>Soon they were deep in the enjoyment of the
other’s company, and oblivious of the other
guests.</p>

<p>They had much to talk over, for a jealous
husband had kept them apart in a most unfeeling
fashion. Perhaps that was what had whetted
appetite. Two bottles of champagne—for she
was fond of a glass of good wine helped to
cheer the evening.</p>

<p>By the time bedtime came, he took both her
hands in his, and whispered. “And what did you
say was the number of your room?”</p>

<p>“I did not say any number, you silly boy,” she
answered, showing her fine teeth, “but as a
matter of fact it is No. 13.”</p>

<p>“An easy one to remember,” he said lightly,
“Good-night,” and he turned to the smoking
room for a night-cap.</p>

<h2>Chapter II. <br> Flight</h2>

<p>Hugh Desmond was more of a hunter
than a libertine. What he desired, he
pursued, but after the capture he was sated, and
would turn to a fresh venture. If he could stop
short before the “kill” he would have been
content. A devil drove him on to the very edge, and
then some instinct less ignoble urged him to
restraint.</p>

<p>For, though he went as Hugh Desmond, which
was his family name, he was in reality the seventh
Lord Reckavile, with a reputation so sinister
that every decent woman shrunk from him till
she knew him, and then fell in love with him.</p>

<p>A soldier of fortune, who had not the patience
to remain in the Army, he had sought death
deliberately instead of glory, in each of the
foreign campaigns in which he had fought, always
driven from country to country by the Curse,
and too poor to take a position in which he might
have earned distinction. He was hounded by a
desire which knew no satisfaction, and a pride
which claimed a high regard for honour.</p>

<p>Such had been the contradiction and the Curse
of his race. It was with a sigh of relief that he
stood on the platform and saw the train bearing
Winnie back to London, and to her husband,
slowly steam away. She had been lacrimose and
vowed that she would never have a day’s
happiness till he saw her again.</p>

<p>He had agreed to her acclamations, but wished
to be quit of her, feeling angry with himself for
a lack of ardour he could not induce.</p>

<p>On the way back to the hotel he made up his
mind for another of those wild expeditions
abroad which had filled most of his life.</p>

<p>Some evil fate led him to pass the Cathedral
Church, where the organ was playing. The artist
in him made him pause in rapture, and he
entered softly. The sensuous odour of incense and
the gorgeous music of the benediction service
greeted him, and the dim lights, the towering
pillars, and the blaze of the high altar, appealed
to his aesthetic fancy, after the gross life of the
last few days. How happily he could have
become a monk, mortifying the flesh and flogging
himself when unholy desires came to taunt him.</p>

<p>To devote his life to the Holy Virgin, and
crush down the base part would be a fight worthy
of his pride.</p>

<p>The organ ceased and the dreams with it. He
looked round, and in the seats opposite to him,
were the girls from the convent school, for this
was a saint’s day.</p>

<p>With a sudden quickening of the pulse he saw
his little wood nymph, her hands clasped and her
face alight with devotion, but now a saint,
transfigured, adorable.</p>

<p>He watched entranced; he could have bent
before her, offering fealty, pleading only for some
token so that he might remain her true knight,
serving only in her cause.</p>

<p>The baser part of him was gone at that
moment, and then she looked round for a brief
moment, and their eyes met.</p>

<p>She turned quickly away, but he could see a
dark flush spread over her lovely face; she had
seen him, and the sight had not affected her as
that of a mere stranger. The blood rushed to his
head. He hastily scribbled a note on a leaf from
his pocket book, and wrapped it in his hand.</p>

<p>The mood of piety had gone, and the hunting
instinct was dominant. As the worshippers left
the building he passed to her side, and as she
turned to bow to Christ on His altar, he slipped
the note into her hand.</p>

<p>The awful impiety of the act almost made her
drop it, but she clutched it to her with a look of
pain, and went out of the sacred building. In
the privacy of her room, she furtively opened the
crumpled piece of paper and read:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Dear little Angel. When I saw you tonight I
  adored you. You are far removed from all other
  beings. If you wish to save a suffering mortal,
  meet me in the woods where we last saw each other.
  Otherwise my death may be on your hands. Fear
  nothing, I will guard you as my own sister. At
  three tomorrow, but I will wait till you come.</p>

  <p class="valediction">Your devoted servant and knight,</p>
  <p class="signature">Hugh Desmond.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In her maiden breast strange feelings were
stirring. She knew it was wrong, that she ought
to take the note to Sister Ursula at once and tell
her the story which she had even withheld from
the father at confession, but that was not
possible. He had been so kind, he had not tried to
stay her, or to say anything at which she could
take offence. And now he said his life was at
stake; perhaps he had some terrible trouble in
which she could help him. If so surely she was
doing right to give him aid.</p>

<p>So she hid the note under her pillow and
dreamt of the morrow.</p>

<p>Desmond waited in the woods, picturing her as
she had sat there in her girlish sweetness, when
he had seen her, till the dusk of evening was
coming on and the birds had ceased to sing. He rose
stiff and cramped. Well, the gods had decided
against him, so there was no use complaining.
She had probably torn up the note or perhaps
even handed it over to the Mother Superior.</p>

<p>Suddenly she stood before him, panting, and
like a fairy in the twilight. He had not heard
her approach, and stood enraptured with the
sight.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know I ought not to have come,” she
said “but we did not go out this afternoon, and
then I thought that you would be waiting, and
after what you said about being in trouble, I felt
I must come, but I cannot stop or they will miss
me.”</p>

<p>“Little Daphne, you have been very kind. I
have ached to see you. I have been here all the
afternoon, and would have stayed all night if
there had been a chance of meeting you.” He
approached her, and she did not shrink from him,
only crossed her hands over her breast, and stood
expectant.</p>

<p>“What did you want to tell me?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Only that you are the loveliest maid in the
world, and I have longed for you since we met.
You have been with me night and day. Oh
Daphne, I love you dearly, and without you I
shall certainly die.”</p>

<p>She drew back then with a quick movement.</p>

<p>“But you said your death would be on my
hands if I did not come?”</p>

<p>“If you will not love me I shall die,” he said,
but the phrase sounded hollow to him.</p>

<p>The setting sun was on her, and an expression
of bewilderment showed on her face. She could
not understand deliberate deceit, and thought she
must have misunderstood him. They remained
for a moment in silence, and in that pause a fight
was taking place in Desmond’s mind, but the
sight of her proved too much, and with one swift
tiger-like movement he took her in his arms.</p>

<p>Had she resisted, or struggled, his hunting
instinct would have overmastered him, but she
remained, neither consenting nor resisting, just as
a child might lie in the arms of its father.</p>

<p>His hot breath was on her cheek, and in a
whisper he said, “I love you, little Daphne, the night
is round us, come, we will love while we may.”
His lips were close to hers, but some invisible
force restrained him. What had he written; he
would treat her as a sister. The word of a
Reckavile was inviolate, whether for good or evil,
and slowly he released her from his close
embrace.</p>

<p>“I will take you back,” he whispered. “It is
too late for you to be out.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I ought to go, but it is so lovely
here, and you are so good to me.”</p>

<p>“Come with me,” he said unable to trust
himself further.</p>

<p>He took her to the garden wall where she had
jumped down, and lifted her young warm body
like a feather.</p>

<p>She was again adorable, and his mood was
exalted. She reached down, and he took her hand
to kiss, but she put two soft arms round his neck
and kissed him frankly as a child might kiss.</p>

<p>“I shall be here every night till you come
again,” he said, disarmed completely.</p>

<p>There was a movement above, and she was
gone.</p>

<p>This meeting was the first of many. Desmond
stayed on at the hotel, and the foreign expedition
was postponed.</p>

<p>Each night he would wait beneath the wall,
which bordered the woods, till all hope of seeing
her had gone. Then he would go to the hotel not
angry but hoping for a happier chance on the
morrow.</p>

<p>She would slip out when she could, fearfully
at first, but as discovery seemed remote, with
growing confidence.</p>

<p>A change came over her. She found herself
thinking more of Hugh as he had taught her to
call him, and less of her devotions. Even at
mass his image was before her, and she felt
wicked, but could not alter her feelings.
Longing seized her for something she only dimly
comprehended; she became moody and irritable, and
neglected her work. Sister Ursula was
distressed, she had grown to love the girl. She
misread the symptoms and thought Carlotta was
pining to be free, like a caged bird. When they
met the talk was all of the strange places he had
seen, and she would listen all eyes and ears,
drinking in every word. And so Desmond stayed
on, cursing himself for the vile thing he was
planning, yet persisting in his scheme. At last
he came to the same spot now sacred to both, and
lifted her down. Both were disturbed. The
autumn was coming on, the time Carlotta
dreaded, for she hated the cold and damp, and
the death of the flowers.</p>

<p>“Daphne, my darling,” he said holding her in
his arms, “I have to go away tomorrow to my
own home to see to matters there. I shall be
away for a week at least. When I come back
I will see you again.” He spoke almost coldly,
and she gave a little cry of pain, and realised
perhaps for the first time what his absence would
mean. She held fast to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, must you go?” she asked with a moan.</p>

<p>“I must, I have been here too long as it is, but
I will come back.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be long, I shall miss you. It is so
lonely without you.”</p>

<p>“Would you come with me to Italy for the
winter?” he whispered, “away from all this cold
and wet, into the sunlight. We can see Venice,
you have never been there, and find your
mother,” he added falsely.</p>

<p>Her body quivered in his embrace, but she
stood silent. When it came to leaving the
Convent and its quiet shelter, and the good Sisters,
a gulf seemed to open beneath her feet.</p>

<p>“I could not,” she said, but the vision of all the
beauties he had pictured, actually possible to her
was dazzling her very soul.</p>

<p>“I will come for you,” he said “and you must
decide for yourself. Only if you don’t come with
me, I must go away altogether.”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” she answered, “it would be too cruel.
If you leave me I shall die. I cannot live
without you.” Her fierce passion was something he
had not seen before. He took her in his arms
then, and kissed her on the mouth, the eyes and
hair, holding her close, and she returned his
kisses with utter abandon, her soft arms round
his neck. He was the first to recover, and gently
disengaged himself. He was trembling; he had
never felt like this in any of his affairs.</p>

<p>“You must go, my darling,” he said very
gently, and lifted her to the wall, not daring to
say more.</p>

<p>She was crying now, softly as she always did,
and the tears fell on him like rain.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” he said hoarsely, and turned
away through the dark woods.</p>

<p>“You scoundrel,” he said to himself. “Now
what are you going to do? She is not like the
others, she will never forget.</p>

<p>“Are you going to leave her, and break her
very soul. She has no mother and no friends
outside the convent. Or are you going to take
her, she is yours for the asking, and ruin her?”</p>

<p>There was another possibility, but he would
not allow his thoughts in that direction—marriage,
but that was horrible. To settle down as
a married man; no that could never be for him.</p>

<p>And so he went irresolute, torn by conflicting
feelings, the sweetness of her kisses an abiding
and tormenting memory.</p>

<p>And Carlotta, for her the old life was done.
It was all biting pain now. She had been
instructed by the Sisters, and she knew right from
wrong. She had been playing with fire, and now
she was burnt.</p>

<p>The days passed in weariness; she tried to
forget in her devotions, but the old fervour would
not come. Perhaps she might have recovered in
time, might even have forgotten, but fate was
playing a part.</p>

<p>He had been gone a week when the Mother
Superior sent for Carlotta.</p>

<p>“Come here, my child,” she said, “I want to
talk to you about your future. We must discuss
what you are to do.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand,” said Carlotta.</p>

<p>“My poor child, it is time you were told the
truth,” and she recounted the story of her
mother, and of her treatment. Carlotta could
have died with shame; her sensitive soul was
deeply wounded. That she had been kept on out
of charity, a foundling; it was awful.</p>

<p>“And so you see, my dear,” the Mother
continued, “we must look out for something for you.
We have places where we train girls, and I think
we can get you into one of those.”</p>

<p>“And I am to leave here?” Carlotta gasped.</p>

<p>“I am afraid so, my dear child, the rules will
not allow you to stay after you are seventeen,
and that will be in a few months.”</p>

<p>She went on talking quietly, but Carlotta
heard nothing. It was as though she were
sinking in deep waters, and a faint sound of a voice
far away was speaking.</p>

<p>She did not cry, but her face was white and
pinched.</p>

<p>“You understand?” asked the Mother and
kissed her.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mother, I will do what you want.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good child, run along now. I will
have another talk when I have heard from the
training college.”</p>

<p>For once her judgment was at fault; she
thought Carlotta had taken it very well, and
would be reconciled to her new life.</p>

<p>No sleep came to Carlotta that night. She
tossed on her bed, and a dry fever tormented her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Holy Mother!” she prayed “take this
shame from me, what can I do?”</p>

<p>When dawn came she was calm; she had made
up her mind once and for all. She was Italian,
and had not the calculating mind of the
northerner; she would go to him, yes, this very
evening, and her courage rose high at the thought.</p>

<p>Desmond was waiting by the wall; the Curse
had driven him back. He must see her, if only
to say good-bye. How often has the Devil tried
this game with success.</p>

<p>She came to the wall, which on the garden side
was low, and leant on the parapet. He noticed
with a start that she was holding a little
hand-bag, so small and dainty that even at the moment
he wondered what on earth she could get into it.</p>

<p>“I am coming with you, if you will take me,”
she said quite calmly.</p>

<p>“My God!” he said, staggering back, “do you
mean it?”</p>

<p>“Of course. You asked me last week, and said
you would come for me.”</p>

<p>He was at a loss. This dainty little girl was
talking like some practiced woman of the world,
or was it sheer innocence?</p>

<p>Then he was swept away, and all moderation
left him. He gathered her from the wall and
seized her roughly in his arms.</p>

<p>“Daphne, my darling, come. We will fly
together, over the blue seas, and love each other
dearly, and no one shall come between us. It
will be all Heaven, and you shall be my angel,
my Love! My Queen!”</p>

<p>The hours sped by in the soft velvet night, and
he took her by the hand, and led her to the town.
His senses came to him, and his quick mind saw
the danger. She would be missed, and a search
made. He went to his hotel, but not to the front
door. He had brought a young fellow from his
estate to look after him, Southgate, son of a
publican, who had some training as a valet. He had
taken him with him before and knew his loyalty
and discretion.</p>

<p>He roused him up from the servants’ quarters.</p>

<p>“Go to the <i>King’s Head</i> down the street, and
hire a trap. Mention no name except a false one,
and say it is an urgent case—an accident. Here
is money. You can return the trap tomorrow
evening. Bring it to the Cross by the London
Road. Hurry, mind, and don’t arouse any
suspicion.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” said the valet, who was used
to his master’s vagaries.</p>

<p>Desmond led Carlotta down the silent street,
and waited at the Cross. She was quiet, and
filled with pure happiness and trust. She had
yielded herself to this man absolutely, and for
ever. The die was cast, and she was content.</p>

<p>They drove off into the night, and he held her
in his arms where she slept like a tired child.</p>

<p>Mile after mile was covered, and dawn was
breaking when she woke to find herself at the
door of an old inn. Southgate jumped down,
and held the steaming horses, while Desmond
lifted her down, and carried her to the house.
The door was opened by an old woman, who
curtseyed to Desmond.</p>

<p>He said something to her in a low voice, and
passed on up the stairs to a door, which the
woman opened, holding a candle for them.</p>

<p>Very gently Desmond laid her on the bed, and
kissed her.</p>

<p>“This good woman will see to you,” he said.
“You will be quite safe here.”</p>

<p>She was so weary that she could scarcely touch
the hot soup which the woman brought her, and
soon was lost in happy dreams.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch203">

<h2>Chapter III. <br> The Marriage</h2>

<p>“When are we going to Italy?” asked
Carlotta. She was sitting happily on
Hugh’s knee, and the sunlight came through the
window of the old Inn.</p>

<p>“I have got the tickets, and booked our
passages. The boat sails on Saturday from Dover,
and we go through France by train.”</p>

<p>She clapped her hands with pleasure.</p>

<p>He looked at her with delight, what a perfect
little girl she was!</p>

<p>“And I’ve got lots of clothes for you. You
must come and see them. Mrs. Southgate has
laid them all out in your bedroom.”</p>

<p>“You are a dear,” she said, and kissed him.</p>

<p>His method had been simple. He had written
to London, explaining that he required a
complete outfit, and giving a description of the lady.
It was not the first time, and the articles had
arrived by return. He had a wealth of faults,
but always paid his debts; it was a peculiarity of
the family.</p>

<p>Carlotta was delighted; what a child she was.
She had worn the school costume, sombre and
uninteresting, so long that the sight of all these
lovely things made her joyous.</p>

<p>Desmond sat and watched her with a glow of
pleasure.</p>

<p>Nothing would satisfy her but to try them on,
and she came to him to do up fastenings or hooks.</p>

<p>It was all joy and happiness, then quite
suddenly she came and put her arms round his neck,
and said:</p>

<p>“Where are we going to get married, here or
in Italy?”</p>

<p>The question staggered him. There was
nothing coaxing or challenging in the voice, and
the question was asked so simply, as though she
was asking where they were going to dine.</p>

<p>Her great dark innocent eyes looked at him,
and a wave of pity, and something as near
remorse as he was capable of, touched him.</p>

<p>“Why, damme,” he said with a laugh, and
with one of those strange resolutions which
madness dictated. “I had not thought of that, little
Daphne, so you would really like to marry me?”
He watched her narrowly. If there had been
tears or reproach he would have stiffened, but
she merely said “Yes please, if you would like
to,” and he was disarmed. He gave a great laugh
and held her to him.</p>

<p>“Caught! By Jove. Very well, sweetheart,
we will get married. Why not, after all?
Married women have a pretty good time, so why not
men?” She looked at him with grave eyes.</p>

<p>“Fancy being your wife. It will be lovely.”</p>

<p>They had no time to spare, as although the
Southgates were loyal and true, the search for
the girl might find them at any moment. He
obtained a special license, and they set out by
road for Dover with gaiety in their hearts, and in
his case an unusual sense of virtue. If she
wondered that she had not met his family or friends,
she put it down to the fact that they must escape
pursuit. He told her they would come back
when all the bother was over and he would show
her London.</p>

<p>At a little village church, where a friend of
Desmond’s was parish priest, and keener on
hunting than his work, they were made man and
wife. She was a Catholic, and did not
understand the ceremony, which was witnessed by
young Southgate and the verger, but when he
placed the ring on her finger, whispering “It was
my Mother’s,” she thought it all very beautiful.</p>

<p>The parson entertained them to a gargantuan
meal, and both the men were soon happily and
noisily drunk, but Carlotta noticed nothing.</p>

<p>“Reckavile, you ruffian, this is the last straw,”
said the parson. Carlotta had never heard the
name before, but in after years she remembered.</p>

<p>“You married! Oh Lord! I thought your line
would at last end with you—at any rate on the
right side. You dog!”</p>

<p>Drunk as he was Reckavile turned grey. “I
had sworn the Curse should die with me. The
Devil has a hand in most things. Pass the
bottle.”</p>

<p>Southgate and the parson’s man helped him
into the chaise, and the parson kissed the bride.</p>

<p>“God bless you, my dear,” he said unsteadily.
“Come and see me again.”</p>

<p>But it was not to be. A stroke took the worthy
man off the next night with consequences which
none of them could have foreseen.</p>

<p>The weeks that followed were one dream of
delight to Carlotta.</p>

<p>They journeyed from town to town, discovering
fresh beauties everywhere. He was charmed
with his young bride, and for a moment the
horrible craving for something new was stayed.</p>

<p>She thought he was showing her Italy, but the
restless craze drove him on, only now he was
happy at last, and satisfied with her sweetness.</p>

<p>At Ancona, where they stayed for several
days, he got his letters.</p>

<p>He was utterly careless in these matters, but
his butler sent him a batch now and then.</p>

<p>They had been watching the Bay from the
battlements, with the sun flashing on the Adriatic
waters, when he took a bulky packet from his
pocket, and opened it carelessly.</p>

<p>There were some bills, some letters from his
Club, and statement from his butler. Nothing
to worry about. Then his eye caught a familiar
writing, and with a quick catch in his breath, and
a dull presentiment of evil he broke the seal.</p>

<p>It was from Winnie, as he had known by the
writing, and he read it through twice. The large
scrawly handwriting was clear enough, but the
news was startling.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p class="salutation">My Darling Hugh,</p>

  <p>Where have you hidden yourself all this time?
  I have enquired everywhere, but no one knows
  anything about you. I am in such dreadful trouble,
  I must see you at once. It is too awful. My
  husband knows all about us. When he came back
  from Germany the servants told him I had been
  away, and he found that we had been stopping at
  that hotel. He put a lawyer on the track, and
  discovered everything. Oh! What are we to do!
  You must come and advise me, and you will stand
  by me won’t you? You know how much I love
  you, and you know you made me unfaithful to my
  husband. You will not leave me now? He is
  getting a divorce and what am I to do? I am
  staying with my mother, as he will not have me. Do
  come to me.</p>

  <p class="valediction">Your broken-hearted</p>
  <p class="signature">Winnie</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There were tear stains, and corrections, and
crosses at the end. The letter was unfair and
gross, and as Hugh looked up from reading it,
he contrasted in his mind the fair young girl,
now throwing little stones over the hedge to see
them drop far below, and the flamboyant beauty
of the other, to whom now he must go, for so
the twisted honour of his race would have it.</p>

<p>“Come, Daphne, let us go back. It is getting
late,” he said, but there was a solemn note in his
voice, which made her ask. “Have you had bad
news?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, just the ordinary worries, but it will
probably mean I shall have to go to England.
Business affairs you know, but don’t trouble,
little girl, I shall not be away from you for long.”</p>

<p>A shadow crossed her lovely face. It was the
first separation.</p>

<p>“Can’t I come too? I would love to see
England properly, London and the big cities.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid not this time, and besides you
would hate the winter. I must get a villa for
you, and you can make everything ready for me
when I come back. It will be quite exciting for
you, furnishing.”</p>

<p>And so it was arranged. Everything had to
be done in a hurry, but then he was used to that.
He bought a charming little Villa at Murano,
and obtained servants for her, while she was to
stay in Venice till she had furnished it. On the
last night she was sad.</p>

<p>“Come back soon,” she said “I shall be so
lonely without you, and …” she stopped.</p>

<p>He was tender with her, but there was a
hunted look in his eyes. He could see only one
way out of the mess, and that he could not tell
her.</p>

<p>She faced the parting bravely, and he was
proud of her. There was no scene such as he had
been accustomed to with others; she smiled at
him, and waved as the train moved out. Only
when she got home to the hotel, she went to her
room and burst into a passionate flood of tears.</p>

<p>Reckavile found all London talking about the
case. The worthy draper had filed his petition,
and only awaited his turn to come to the courts.
Winnie he would not see, and rumour gathered
round the action Reckavile would take. Betting
was about even on his marrying the woman or
killing the draper.</p>

<p>Those who knew him were certain he would
face the music.</p>

<p>He paid two visits, one to his family lawyer to
enter a defence, and one to an intimate friend,
Captain Wynter. He found the latter at the
Club, and with his usual abruptness opened at
once.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard of this silly business about the
man Wheatland, eh?” Wynter nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, I want you to take a challenge to him.
Tell him I’ll fight him for the lady.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” said the other, dropping his
eyeglass in his astonishment, “are you joking?
That sort of thing is quite out of date,
unfortunately, otherwise one would not have to put up
with the insults one meets with nowadays.”</p>

<p>“I mean it quite seriously, I am in a devil of
a mess, and if he can plug me, all the better. It
will end the line, and everyone will be satisfied.”</p>

<p>Wynter looked at him, and realised he was
serious, and in a dangerous mood. It would be
best to pacify him, and rather a joke to frighten
the draper; perhaps even it might stay
proceedings.</p>

<p>He drew up the challenge with all the
formality of a century ago, and showed it to Reckavile,
who gravely agreed, without apparently seeing
any humour in the situation.</p>

<p>Wynter dressed himself in his best, and hailing
a hansom cab, drove to Wheatland Emporium in
Highbury.</p>

<p>He found him, an anxious worried little man,
pompous and vain, with horrible mutton chop
whiskers.</p>

<p>He had risen by energy and hard work
through the stages of assistant to shop-walker
and manager, until he had obtained a shop of his
own, and his middle aged affection had been
lavished on his cashier Winnie, then a beautiful
young girl, and ambitious.</p>

<p>She had married him for his money, hoping to
twist him round her fingers, and found him vain
and jealous, and exacting in his ideas both of
marital duty and spending limits.</p>

<p>Wynter he greeted with the artificial smile of
the business man expecting custom, and the
latter bowed politely; he was enjoying his part.
“Mr. Wheatland, I believe?” he said.</p>

<p>“The same, sir, at your service,” answered the
other.</p>

<p>“May I have a word with you, sir?” said the
soldier.</p>

<p>“Certainly, come to my office.”</p>

<p>Seated in Wheatland’s private room, Wynter
felt a sudden distaste at his mission. After all,
this poor man had been treated badly, and he
had his rights like anyone else.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I have come on an unpleasant
errand,” he said “I represent Lord Reckavile.”</p>

<p>The draper stiffened. “I do not wish to hear
anything from that man, my lawyer has the
matter in hand.”</p>

<p>Wynter waved his hand. “This is not a
lawyer’s business, but a personal one—my friend
Reckavile feels that you have a distinct
grievance, in fact that you have the right to demand
satisfaction. He is willing to waive his rank, and
will meet you, if you will nominate a second with
whom I may arrange details.”</p>

<p>“A second, I don’t understand,” said the
bewildered Wheatland.</p>

<p>“Exactly, a friend who will act for you. You
can then fight for the lady. He feels that as the
aggrieved party you have the right to challenge,
but you might feel diffident on account of the
disparity in rank.” He produced his Cartel and
spread it out.</p>

<p>The little man’s eyes fairly bulged in his head.</p>

<p>“Either you are playing a very discreditable
practical joke, or your friend is mad. Fight, sir,
I never heard such rubbish. Are we back in the
Middle Ages? The Law, sir, will give me
protection, and I shall immediately communicate
with my solicitor to stop this murderous ruffian.”</p>

<p>Then his manner changed, and in a whining
tone he said, “Is it not enough that he has
seduced my wife, whom I loved with all my heart,
but he must seek my life as well.”</p>

<p>Wynter felt uncomfortable, and cursed
himself for coming.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, and buttoned up his coat,
thrusting his famous challenge into his pocket.</p>

<p>“Then I may take it, Mr. Wheatland, that you
will not fight,” he said.</p>

<p>“Certainly not, sir, I never heard anything so
preposterous in my life,” said the other.</p>

<p>“Very good, but on one point you are wrong.
Reckavile is a strange creature, and he does not
wish to kill you; in fact he was hoping you would
kill him.”</p>

<p>Wheatland gazed at him open-mouthed.</p>

<p>“Kill him, sir, and how much better off should
I be if I were hanged for murder, than if I were
murdered myself. And what would become of
my business; I should look ridiculous.”</p>

<p>Wynter felt he had better terminate the
interview.</p>

<p>“Good-day, Mr. Wheatland,” he said bowing
slightly.</p>

<p>Wheatland laid a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“He will marry her, won’t he sir, when I have
my divorce; I should not like to think he would
desert her.”</p>

<p>There was something in the tone which went to
Wynter’s heart. This stubborn man, who would
not forgive, and who was willing to face publicity
for the sake of his personal honour, yet hoped
that the woman would find happiness or at any
rate safety by marrying the man.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him,” said Wynter hurriedly, and
went out.</p>

<p>Reckavile was waiting for him in the Club.
He had occupied his time in tossing a friend for
sovereigns, and had liberally attended to his
needs for liquid refreshment.</p>

<p>He listened in scornful silence to Wynter’s
recital.</p>

<p>“And so the merchant won’t fight,” he said.</p>

<p>“Not likely,” said Wynter with a loud laugh
“and the best of the joke is he wants you to
marry the woman.”</p>

<p>Reckavile sat up straight and Wynter eyed
him narrowly.</p>

<p>“Of course, that’s your affair, old man, but it
certainly looks as though you are caught at last,”
and he slapped the other on the back. “We all
know about the Reckavile honour. You are all
blackguards of the worst type, but men of
honour of a sort—a curious sort.”</p>

<p>There were several in the group, and they
laughed boisterously.</p>

<p>“Damn you, you need not remind me of that,”
said Reckavile, his thoughts were with a little
lady with great eyes in Italy, watching for his
coming with a lovelit face, whom this same sense
of honour has compelled him to marry. He
shook himself.</p>

<p>“You’ll all dine with me,” he said “and we’ll
have a flutter afterwards, but I’m sorry the
merchant would not fight.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch204">

<h2>Chapter IV. <br> The Divorce and After</h2>

<p>Wheatland got his divorce. There
was no defence, for when Reckavile
considered the matter with his family lawyer, he
decided not to have certain letters read in court,
and all the details published in the papers.</p>

<p>He wandered restlessly between London and
his castle at Portham, not able to leave for Italy
till the case was over. He wrote Carlotta,
passionate love letters, but gave no address, for to
her he was Hugh Desmond, and no other.</p>

<p>In spite of all the appeals made to him by
Winnie in tearful and illiterate letters, he made
no answer, nor would he see her. He told his
lawyer to look to it that she wanted for nothing,
and there the matter rested.</p>

<p>It was the day after the decree nisi had been
pronounced when Reckavile went to his lawyer,
Mr. Curtis, head of Curtis, Figgis and Brice, for
a final interview as he was leaving for Italy the
next day.</p>

<p>The thought thrilled him, as he pictured her
whose whole longing was bound up in him, with
no aspiration after title, or social position, and
trust—absolute trust—that was the very devil.</p>

<p>Curtis was speaking.</p>

<p>“Of course, I don’t know what you propose to
do, Lord Reckavile, when the decree is made
absolute—it is hardly my affair, except—ahem—as
the old family lawyer who knew your
father, perhaps …” he stopped confused.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“What I meant to convey was, that if you
made the lady an allowance as you are doing, it
would appear sufficient. In your position I do
not think an alliance would be desirable or even
necessary.”</p>

<p>Reckavile’s face hardened.</p>

<p>“You mean as I have compromised the lady,
I should now desert her—of course, with an
allowance,” he added bitingly.</p>

<p>Curtis was uneasy, for he knew the
Reckaviles; but the marriage must be stopped. He
tried once more.</p>

<p>“It would never do. You know that the estate
is heavily mortgaged, and you are well—rather
careless in money matters. I had hoped that you
would marry some desirable lady of your class,
with sufficient funds to put the family in a
satisfactory position. I think that is very necessary.”</p>

<p>He paused at the look on Reckavile’s face.
His eyes were dull black, like a snake’s, and his
mouth was twisted in a fiendish smile.</p>

<p>Curtis knew that look only too well.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Curtis,” he said “I was
undecided, and thought of tossing for it, but you have
made up my mind for me. I shall certainly
marry the woman—or at least give her my name
for what it is worth, and that should be sufficient
punishment for anyone.”</p>

<p>“But, my Lord …”</p>

<p>Reckavile held up his hand. “There is no need
for further discussion.”</p>

<p>A knock sounded at the door, and the clerk
came in.</p>

<p>“A lady wishes to see Lord Reckavile,” he
said to Curtis “she would not wait, sir, and
seemed very impatient.”</p>

<p>He was brushed aside, and Winnie swept into
the office. Her colour was high, and she
certainly looked a beauty at that moment.</p>

<p>The worry of the last few months instead of
marring her looks, had softened the lines of her
face, and her fine eyes were appealing. She
came straight to Reckavile, ignoring the lawyer
altogether, but something in the sternness of his
face made her pause.</p>

<p>“Oh Hugh!” she said, not venturing to go to
him, “why have you treated me like this? You
have taken no notice of my letters, and refused
to see me. Are you going to desert me after you
have ruined me?” Her voice broke, and there
were signs of coming tears.</p>

<p>“You need have no apprehension on that
score,” he answered coldly. “I have already
discussed the matter with Mr. Curtis here. When
the time comes, you shall become Lady
Reckavile, and have my <em>honoured</em> name. You have a
witness here,” and he smiled like Satan at Curtis.</p>

<p>“But Hugh, you are so hard, so cold. It is
your love I want as well as to be your wife,” she
added hastily.</p>

<p>He was unmoved.</p>

<p>“I have said, Winnie, that you shall become
my wife. Anything else I do not care to discuss,
especially before another.” Curtis had remained
in the hope that he could dissuade Reckavile
from his purpose, but he now hastily made to
go, when the other stopped him.</p>

<p>“No, Curtis, don’t go. There is nothing to
add. I am leaving England, and you know
where to find me. This lady can communicate
with you, and you will continue her allowance.
When my presence is necessary I will come.
You can arrange the details at a registry office,
as quietly as possible. No fuss, please, and
above all keep it out of the papers.”</p>

<p>Winnie turned red with anger and shame.
How brutal he was and callous, it was worse than
anything that had gone before. Before she could
collect her thoughts Reckavile had turned on his
heel, and strode from the room.</p>

<p>She would have tried tears, or a passionate
appeal, but what was the good of that with a
dry old lawyer, whose face was impassive.</p>

<p>“What a way to treat me after all I have been
through for him,” she blazed out, but Curtis
remained silent.</p>

<p>“He said he loved me, and that he would
remain true to me,” she went on.</p>

<p>“I am afraid Lord Reckavile has said that to
many,” said Curtis dryly, drawing a paper
towards him, “and as for standing by you, you are
the first who has had the honour of becoming
Lady Reckavile.”</p>

<p>His tone was final, and she felt the futility of
talking to a parchment faced lawyer, whose
sympathies were obviously with Lord Reckavile, and
who considered she was getting out of it very
well. With a toss of her head she went, vowing
she would never enter the place again.</p>

<p>And Reckavile paced the deck of the Channel
boat, deep in thought. His mind ran on suicide,
which was the common weakness in his family,
and generally the solution of impossible
positions.</p>

<p>Then another thought came to him, and the
more he turned it over, the better he liked it.
Why not end the Line without violent means.
He would give Winnie his name and the Estate
for what it was worth. As Lord Reckavile he
would cease to exist, but in sunny Italy, Hugh
Desmond would bury himself with his little wife,
and he would earn a living by his painting, for
he was no mean artist.</p>

<p>The idea pleased him. Flowers and kisses, and
lying in the sun, with not too much work, and
perhaps a minor war or so to chase away
boredom. By the time he had reached Italy he had
made up his mind. There was only one more
hurdle, the ceremony in London, and then
happiness awaited him. The bigamy did not worry
him in the least, such trifles were nothing to a
Reckavile.</p>

<p>At Venice he waited all day, and a strange
feeling of apprehension came to him. Suppose
something had happened to Carlotta in his
absence; he had left her, a mere girl—alone, with
only servants of whom he knew nothing.
Suppose she were ill, or even dead. A nervousness
never felt before beset him. Impatiently he
drove out to Murano, and came to the Villa San
Rocco. Night was falling as he passed through
the lovely garden, and approached the windows
from which a soft light shone. She was sitting
inside, a piece of work had dropped from her
hands to the floor, and her great eyes were
gazing at nothing. How sweet she looked and how
dainty, but so sad. He had never seen her thus,
and pity filled his heart, and reproach.</p>

<p>He entered through the open window, and
with a great cry she came to him, holding out
both arms. He took her to himself in a
passionate embrace, and with a feeling deeper than the
old stirring of desire. She raised her radiant
face to his in perfect happiness.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hugh, I am so happy. You’ve come
back to me.”</p>

<p>There was no word of reproach, no shadow of
fretfulness at his long absence.</p>

<p>The past and future were gone, and for the
moment the pure bliss of being together absorbed
their beings.</p>

<p>She roused herself with a happy laugh, and
kissed him, her face rosy with delight.</p>

<p>“I must tell the servants about dinner, and you
will want to dress won’t you?”</p>

<p>She looked older, more self assured, but more
beautiful than ever, he thought.</p>

<p>He had left his bag in the carriage, and went
for it, and to pay the driver.</p>

<p>When he returned, she was waiting for him,
and led him shyly to their room, fragrant with
flowers, and the odours of the night.</p>

<p>She showed him everything with childish
pleasure, all arranged for his return, and his
dressing room on which she had lavished such care,
overlooking the rose garden.</p>

<p>Dinner was laid in the loggia, and he seated
himself with a sigh of contentment. The
spotless linen and sparkling glass and silver added
to his sense of happiness. She rose and filled his
glass, and he made her sip from it first, the scent
of her hair and the nearness of her warm body
intoxicating him. He would have taken her into
his arms, but that the servants were hovering
near.</p>

<p>She was dressed in a soft evening gown, which
showed the perfect lines of her young body, and
he wondered at her beauty.</p>

<p>Never once did she ask him where he had been,
or what he had been doing, but listened as he told
her of England, and then recounted the little
trifles of her life, so pathetically filled with the
sorrow at his absence though she did not speak
of it.</p>

<p>They sat over their coffee while he smoked a
cigar from his Club, which had never seemed so
fragrant before.</p>

<p>At last he rose.</p>

<p>“It is getting chilly, darling,” he said in a voice
he tried to steady. “Let’s go to bed.”</p>

<p>A deep blush dyed her neck and face, as she
rose and took his hand.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch205">

<h2>Chapter V. <br> The Second Marriage</h2>

<p>The summons had come, and Hugh braced
himself to meet the call. Would to God
he could have refused to go; to pretend that he
was dead, anything to get out of it. But the
perverted honour of the Curse drove him to play
the last scene to the end.</p>

<p>“I shall only be away for a week, Darling,”
he told her. “There is a certain property of mine
I must look after.” That was true.</p>

<p>“When I come back this time, I shall not leave
you again.”</p>

<p>She smiled at him; the wrench was not so bad
this time, and she had other things to think of.
When he came back she would tell him, and she
hid her secret close, nursing the thought in her
breast.</p>

<p>She came with him to Venice, careful that he
had everything for the journey, papers and
cigars. He watched her with a dull sense of
pain; the deception hurt him as nothing had done
before.</p>

<p>He had converted a shed into a studio, and she
had posed for him, as he had said at their first
meeting. Already one picture was finished, and
he would have sold it, but could not bear to part
with it. Another was half done, which he would
finish when he came back, he told himself.</p>

<p>In London, summer was at its height, but he
had no pleasure in it. The Club nauseated him,
and the old companions found him changed, dull
and uninteresting. He was out of touch with
things. Only Wynter and a few intimates who
knew, surmised that the prospect of marriage
had caused the change, and behind his back
betted how long he would retain faithful to his
marriage vows.</p>

<p>Winnie he met only at the lawyer’s the day
before the wedding. She found him cold and
reserved, but he was startled with the change in
her. She was sweetness itself, her voice subdued
and a look in her eyes he had never seen before.
He thought her much improved, and was glad
of it. She made no mention of his absence, nor
did she speak of the past, she seemed to be
seeing a vision. Wynter and two friends had
promised to come to the registry office with him,
prepared for a joke, but his face subdued them, and
they became silent. A visit to the Club first was
insisted upon. Reckavile wore his ordinary
clothes, with no sign of the bridegroom about
him.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, man,” said Wynter “it’s not an
execution you know, and after all there are worse
things. You will have a better chance as a
married man, they always get the pick of the bunch.”</p>

<p>They all laughed, and Reckavile seemed to
rouse himself.</p>

<p>“Another bottle,” he said with his old gaiety,
“why are we going thirsty? Call that damned
waiter.”</p>

<p>They were far from thirsty, when they came
to the place where Curtis looking like an
undertaker, met them with the marriage settlement.
It was the most wicked document he had ever
drawn up, for Reckavile had made over
everything which was not entailed to his wife, no
doting swain sick with love could have bartered
himself away so completely. It was the price he was
paying for his folly, but Curtis little knew what
was in his mind. It appeared to him sheer
madness. Winnie had scarcely looked at it, and she
went up in the opinion of the old lawyer, who
expected a sordid interest. She seemed quite
content to have Hugh without any thought of
money. And she certainly was beautiful, more
so than ever before, thought Hugh, not realising
that every woman is transfigured on her bridal
day.</p>

<p>Then for a moment something comes to her in
a flash, whether with the organ pealing in some
grand old Church, or in the squalid surroundings
of the registry office, a light from the Unknown
illuminates her soul, and departs leaving only the
memory of a guest that tarrieth but an hour.</p>

<p>Winnie had brought a girl friend with her,
a devoted little soul who had stuck by her all
through and borne with her moods. That she
was young and attractive was quite enough for
the amorous Wynter, who began to make violent
love to her at once.</p>

<p>The ceremony was over, with that blinding
swiftness which has an element of indecency in
it. Before they realised that it had started, they
were signing their names, and the step had been
taken from which there is no retreat. The
situation was beginning to appeal to Reckavile’s
cynical mind. After all Italy was far, and why the
devil should one be tied up with one woman. To
hell with convention. He had been too solemn,
too wrapped up in domesticity; it was a great
mistake. There was an awkward pause, and
Winnie looked shyly at him, while the fussy little
registrar buzzed around getting signatures of
witnesses.</p>

<p>Well, why not? Reckavile took Winnie by
both hands and kissed her, if not with affection,
at any rate with a satisfying thoroughness.</p>

<p>The ice was broken, and Wynter and the two
friends he had brought followed suit, taking
liberal toll both with Winnie and Florrie, her
friend, whose surname no one troubled to ask.</p>

<p>Even the old lawyer began to thaw, now that
the irrevocable step had been taken.</p>

<p>Wynter had arranged for a private room at
the Gloucester, and thither they adjourned.
Curtis protested, but was lifted bodily into a
cab by the others, and brought along as a trophy.</p>

<p>The lunch was a merry one; Reckavile threw
off all his moodiness. It would be time enough
to tell Winnie what he intended to do later on.
He was going to send her to Reckavile Castle,
where he had arranged matters with the butler,
and he was for Italy. He knew there would be
a scene, and it would be as well to play the farce
out first.</p>

<p>Soon corks were popping, the wine was
running free and Wynter filled Curtis’ glass to the
brim.</p>

<p>“But I never take anything now,” he protested
“I suffer much with the gout.”</p>

<p>“That shows what a wicked youth you were,”
said Wynter “but all doctors agree about the
hair of the dog that bit you. Drink up old Deed
Box, and smile at the Bride.”</p>

<p>As the meal proceeded the guests became more
riotous. Wynter was one who seldom showed
signs of excess; he became solemnly humorous,
and then slept, but now he rose unsteadily to his
feet and gazed around with an owlish expression.</p>

<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen, I rise to propose
t’health of the Bride. ’Ont congratulate you.
Reckavile is sad dog, like all his family, but hope
fot’ best. Congratulate Hugh, damned pretty
woman, beg pardon, Ladies, but ’struth. Wish
I had married her myself. Never mind. Lucky
to have hooked him, many tried
unsuccessively—wrong—unsuccess …, without success, t’ats
better.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t want long speeches. Here’s to
Bride, and all the little Reckaviles, past, present
and to come,” and he sat down.</p>

<p>“Get up you ass, and propose the toast,” said
Harding, one of the guests attempting to pour
port into Curtis’ glass, and spilling most on the
table.</p>

<p>“I never take port now,” said the unhappy
Curtis “the doctor has absolutely forbidden it.”</p>

<p>“Stupid ass, the doctor,” said Harding “Port
best thing for gout in the world.”</p>

<p>Wynter rose again with difficulty and gave his
toast which was drunk with musical or unmusical
honours. A waiter entered to ask whether
anything was required, and Harding hit him with a
ripe watermelon, which exploded over his shirt
front, and he retired.</p>

<p>“Speech,” said Wynter clapping his hands
vigorously.</p>

<p>Winnie’s face was flushed though she had
drunk sparingly. In a few tasteful words she
thanked Wynter, and hoped that she would make
a good wife for Hugh, and that he did not regret
the step he had taken. It was a good little
speech, and Reckavile was pleased with her. She
was a damned good sort, he found himself
repeating, and the subaltern on his left whose very
name he had forgotten agreed heartily with him.</p>

<p>Florrie had left the table and was sitting at the
piano playing soft tunes, while Harding was
tickling her neck with a peacock’s feather he had
taken from an ornament on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Wynter rose to his feet again.</p>

<p>“Young couple want to start on Honeymoon.
Got a proposiss … a proposal. They want
to go to Reckavile Castle. The trains no good,
too unromantic, I got my coach here, won
competition yesterday, or day before, I forget which.
Bring it round here, and we’ll all go in style.
Only just beyond Brighton eh? No distance.
What der say Hugh, old bounder?”</p>

<p>It suited Reckavile’s mood. Anything to get
into the air, and the swift motion especially with
the excitement of being driven by a drunken man
appealed to him. After all he might just as well
see her to the Castle, it was more seemly, then he
could slip away from there.</p>

<p>Wynter issued his orders to a waiter who
peeped through the door, holding it like a shield
in case of attack. The meal had now become an
orgy; even Winnie had let herself go, and Curtis
was reciting <i lang="fr">risqué</i> stories which had lain
dormant in his mind for a generation. The
subaltern had slipped to the floor, and Florrie was
sitting on Harding’s knee, while he proposed
solemnly to her again and again. Reckavile was
singing <i>Tom Bowling</i> to his own accompaniment,
while empty bottles strewed the floor, and
the spilt wine ran on the table like the blood of a
sacrifice.</p>

<p>The sound of a horn outside roused the
revellers, and Wynter gathered his passengers
together.</p>

<p>They must all come, he would take no refusals.
Only Curtis was adamant, and at last they gave
up trying to persuade him. The rest were packed
away, and they started off, the horses trotting
bravely out of London.</p>

<p>They were all sound asleep before they
reached Portham, and the gloomy old castle in
the woods, only Wynter had driven at a
cracking pace, and the air had sobered him.</p>

<p>“Sound your horn, now, a joyful blast,” he
said to the groom, and the lad responded with
vigour.</p>

<p>All was bustle and excitement when they
arrived, the servants crowded to the door, the butler
leading, and helped the stiff party down. They
had expected only Lady Reckavile, as Hugh had
told them, but the great kitchen was soon busy,
for in those days when telephones and motors
were unknown every country house was well
stocked, and soon chickens and hams were
simmering, and the table groaned with good fare.</p>

<p>“Brandy, and plenty of it,” said Reckavile
swallowing a lump in his dried throat.</p>

<p>Winnie went straight to her room; she wanted
to look her best at dinner. The mad party had
no luggage, except Wynter who had brought his
on the coach, and there was much merriment as
Wynter’s two friends raided Reckavile’s ample
wardrobe.</p>

<p>The night was far spent when they rose to seek
repose.</p>

<p>Reckavile through a mist saw a vision of
loveliness, and Italy was forgotten.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot to be said for Mahomet, and his
sporting religion,” he said musingly. “It’s a
dull life with only one woman.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch206">

<h2>Chapter VI. <br> The Blow Falls</h2>

<p>Three days they kept it up. Wynter
discovered new wonders in the cellar each day,
and while at breakfast everyone was discussing
trains, towards evening departure had been
forgotten. Reckavile was first down, in a dressing
gown, and stood before the great fireplace in the
hall, now empty and black.</p>

<p>The morning was far gone, but none of his
guests showed any sign of appearing.</p>

<p>The butler approached him with <i>The Times</i>
newspaper, and a large bumper of brandy. He
idly opened the paper, and glanced at the news,
then a pang shot through him as he read of an
earthquake shock which had been felt in northern
Italy, and several houses had been demolished
near Venice. A great wave of disgust went over
him, and his thoughts went back to the little villa,
and the poor girl waiting for him, perhaps
overtaken by this hideous menace.</p>

<p>The moment he thought of this fair child in
danger, he sickened of his surroundings. God,
what a hog he was. He looked in the glass and
saw the blotched face and heavy eyes, and with
a blow he smashed the heavy mirror, careless of
a bleeding fist. The butler came in alarmed at
the sound, though he was inured to most things
in that house.</p>

<p>“Have you hurt yourself, my lord?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing, get one of the servants to clear
up that mess.”</p>

<p>“They say it’s unlucky, my lord, breaking a
mirror,” said the butler, gazing ruefully at the
ruin.</p>

<p>“Unlucky, be damned, you fool, have you ever
known a Reckavile anything else but unlucky.
Get me another brandy.”</p>

<p>There was only one thing to do. He would
write no farewell letter, that was so common, so
vulgar; he would melt away. Never mind
luggage, he had the money he had got ready to take
with him after the wedding.</p>

<p>“Where is Lady Reckavile?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Her maid has taken breakfast to her, my
Lord.”</p>

<p>“Very good, you may go, here take this glass
with you,” and he handed his empty glass to the
butler.</p>

<p>At the corner of the drive he paused; the wood
closed thick beyond, and he looked back at the
sombre pile of the old house, for some instinct
told him that he would never see it again. Then
the woods swallowed him up, and he set his face
to the distant railway at Portham Junction.</p>

<p>Carlotta was waiting for him in the little haven
of rest, so calm after the turgid days that had
passed, and he felt at peace again.</p>

<p>It was so charming to sit and listen to the
small trifles of interest which had come to
Carlotta’s quiet life, the earthquake which had not
touched them, but had been much talked of, and
the hot weather which was causing a drought.</p>

<p>When they were sitting together after dinner,
she shyly took up a piece of work, and plied her
needle while he smoked and watched her.</p>

<p>A great contentment settled on his soul.</p>

<p>He would get on with his pictures, and the old
past would fade. There would be no ghosts this
time, and after a time the new Lady Reckavile
would presume him dead, perhaps marry again,
it was all one to him.</p>

<p>The soft night air played about them, and only
the sound of some night insect came from the
garden.</p>

<p>All at once his attention was rivetted by the
sight of what Carlotta was sewing. Half
consciously he looked at it, wondering at first, and
then his mind became focussed, and he could not
take his eyes from the little garment. Slowly
realisation came, and a wave of mixed emotion
swept over him. Horror, exaltation, pity and
regret were equally blended.</p>

<p>In a hushed voice he said “Little Daphne,
what are you working at?”</p>

<p>Her face sunk down over her work, and a
crimson like a sunset dyed her neck.</p>

<p>“Can’t you guess?” she whispered. “I could
not tell you.”</p>

<p>A tumult of many waters went over him.
What did this mean? He knew of course, what
she was telling him, there was no doubt of that,
but what in God’s name was to be the outcome
now.</p>

<p>The line he had sworn to end, with its Curse
and madness. And the child. What of that?
By all the laws of God and man this was the
heir, and why should he be kept from his title?
What right had he to say that this should be
plain Desmond, when he should be Reckavile.
He was dumb, and rose and fled into the night
without a word. Here he paced the rose garden
wrestling with his thoughts. Cursed fool! He
had never thought, never realised.</p>

<p>And that farce in London, if he had only
known before. Oh God! talk about honour,
where was the honour in giving his name to a
woman who had sought trouble with her eyes
open, when he had betrayed an innocent child
unborn, and sold his birthright for a freakish
principle. Well, he need not decide now,
sufficient for the day; that was the old motto.
Anything might happen. And then a sudden
realisation of what Carlotta must be feeling struck
him like a blow, and he turned to the loggia.</p>

<p>She was weeping quietly, as she had always
done, but passionately and with abandonment.</p>

<p>She had misunderstood, he was an artist, and
she knew he admired her beauty. She had
thought he was angry that her loveliness would
be marred, and she would be unsightly, hideous
to him.</p>

<p>She wished he had not come back. Then he
came in and took her into his arms.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, little Daphne,” he said very
tenderly, “I have guessed your secret, poor child,
and you had not told me.”</p>

<p>“Are you angry with me?” she murmured. “I
thought you would be pleased. Fancy …
but I must whisper it.”</p>

<p>She was only a child, delicate and sensitive as
a flower.</p>

<p>“I understand, Darling, but it came as a shock
at first. Poor little Daphne! How you must
have been worrying by yourself.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter, only I thought you would
be pleased,” and the light shone in her starry
eyes. “I would have told you before you went
away, only I did not like to.”</p>

<p>He burst into a wild discordant laugh, which
frightened her.</p>

<p>“Oh, the Curse. This is real humour, only a
joke of the worst taste.”</p>

<p>Then he saw her white puzzled face, and set
himself to comfort her. She had little secrets to
tell him. There was a cot hidden away which
must be brought out, a delicate fairy thing of
blue silk, and lace, and a casket fitted with tiny
brushes and ivory boxes.</p>

<p>It made him feel clumsy and awkward—out
of place. He knelt by her and took her hands.</p>

<p>“Do you remember, little Daphne, when we
met in the woods, and I said I would paint you
as a Madonna, and how shocked you were?”</p>

<p>She nodded gravely; it had been their first
meeting, and the memory of that had always
been with her.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I shall paint you as our Blessed
Lady with the Bambino.”</p>

<p>She blushed deeply, and her eyes spoke her
thoughts.</p>

<p>“It would be too much honour, but …”
and the tears which came so easily now, started
to her eyes.</p>

<p>He was very gentle with her in the days that
followed, and the old unrest was quieted. They
would walk in the rose garden, amid the flowers,
and all that was best in the man shone out like a
star in a cloud wrack, calm and strong. She
leaned more on him as the time went on, and
found him a rock of support. There was no
painting now, only sweet companionship and
expectancy.</p>

<p>An English doctor came post haste in answer
to Hugh’s message, and while he was within
Hugh stamped up and down the garden,
cursing, angry with the futile wrath of a man who
would gladly offer up his blood, his life, to save
from pain one over whom the Dark Shadow was
resting.</p>

<p>How unfair that he who could stand anything
with a cold disdain, should be impotent, while
this tender girl was suffering. It touched his
pride as well; he had been used to sympathy and
respect for his endurance. He would have
preferred that she should watch how indifferent he
was to pain and admire him. It was most unfair.</p>

<p>But the ordeal was over at last, and the doctor,
Halley, came from the house, his face beaming.</p>

<p>“It is all over, Mr. Desmond,” he said, “and
you need have no anxiety. She was brave,
splendid—and the child is a fine boy—a credit to his
mother; you will be proud of them both.”</p>

<p>Damp perspiration stood on Hugh’s forehead,
and he felt a fool. He was not made for
domesticity, and a feeling of repulsion mixed with the
relief.</p>

<p>“Come in and have a drink, Doctor,” he said
“these things are very worrying.”</p>

<p>Dr. Halley understood men, and he followed
Hugh into the lounge where they toasted the new
arrival.</p>

<p>No peace was now in Hugh’s tortured soul,
the Curse had him in its grip. He was fiercely
jealous of the child for monopolising all
Carlotta’s time and attention, exacting in his
demands and resentful if not dissatisfied. And he
must now share her with this intruder, no longer
was she wholly his, responsive to his very word.
Another claimed her, and the old restless mood
returned; he was drunk three parts of the day,
and sulked during the rest.</p>

<p>Carlotta sorrowed in secret, but the little one
kept her busy; later he would take an interest;
it was unreasonable to expect a man to care for
a senseless piece of humanity, which demanded
only food and sleep. At times he would rouse
himself, and the great picture was begun, in the
fair garden, the Holy Mother with her Child,
but he wanted to paint the child as a fiend, the
bodily representative of the Curse, which had
stolen his little Daphne.</p>

<p>And so the months passed, and the spring had
come. A strange friendship had sprung up
between the Doctor, Halley, and Hugh. Like
everyone with whom he came in contact, Hugh
exercised a fascination over the Doctor. His
charming manners, and beautiful face, even the
sadness which pervaded him, attracted while they
repelled.</p>

<p>He was a frequent visitor at the villa, first for
professional reasons, then to see Hugh, and at
last for another reason which he dared not
confess even to himself.</p>

<p>He was dining with the Desmonds with a few
friends, when the blow fell. As Hugh came
down for dinner, he picked up a letter in the hall,
and put it into his pocket.</p>

<p>He knew the writing only too well, it was from
Curtis.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant little party, but a strange
foreboding made Hugh distrait. When the
ladies had gone, and the men were smoking, he
took the letter from his pocket, and asking
permission of his guests broke the seal. Inside was
another letter, and his heart gave a bound as he
saw the scrawly writing of Winnie. He had
received letters full of appeal from her—asking
him to come back. She had thought him at some
foreign war, and could only write through
Curtis, who was Sphinx-like as to his place of abode.
Finally he had told Curtis not to forward any
more. Why had he broken this instruction?</p>

<p>He balanced this one in front of the fire;
better burn it and let the dead past bury its dead,
but something stayed his hand, and he broke the
seal.</p>

<p>He sat so long staring into the fire, that his
guests gave sidelong glances at him. His face
was ashen, and there was a devil peeping out of
his eyes. At last the silence became intolerable,
and the Doctor asked, “Nothing wrong,
Desmond, I hope.”</p>

<p>Hugh gave a horrible laugh which sent a
shudder down the backs of his listeners.</p>

<p>“Wrong! No, splendid news. I am sorry to
be so rude. A great friend or enemy of mine, I
am not certain which, is about to become a happy
father, good luck to him. Let’s come and join
the ladies.”</p>

<p>His gaiety that evening was contagious, and
Carlotta hoped that he was getting over his
moods, and coming back to his old self.</p>

<p>When the others had gone he kissed her
tenderly good-night.</p>

<p>“I shall not be coming yet, Daphne,” he said,
using the old name. “I want to have a think.”</p>

<p>“All right, Darling,” she replied, lifting her
sweet eyes to him. “But you look tired and
worn, poor Hugh!”</p>

<p>“Never mind me,” he said almost impatiently
“Daphne, where do you keep your marriage
certificate?”</p>

<p>The question startled her. She treasured this
sacred document with her most intimate
possessions though she had never looked at it. She had
never refused him a request in her life, but
something made her hesitate to tell him.</p>

<p>“Do you want to see it, Darling?” she pleaded.</p>

<p>“Yes, please,” he said in the tone she knew
meant obedience, and she fetched it for him.</p>

<p>“You will take care of it, Darling, won’t you?”</p>

<p>It was placing her honour in his hands.</p>

<p>She went slowly out of the room, feeling as
though he had taken her child from her.</p>

<p>All night Hugh paced the garden. Winnie
was going to have a child, and little Roy in his
cot upstairs was to be dispossessed of his
birthright. The crisis had come at last, which he had
refused to meet. Only one course was open to
him, and that he would take to the bitter end.
The Curse had handed him his poison cup, and
he must drink as became a Reckavile.</p>

<p>He would go to England, yes at once, without
farewells which he hated, or an explanation
which he could not give with those clear eyes on
him.</p>

<p>He would produce the marriage certificate,
that would be necessary, and proclaim his
infamy. He must put Carlotta in her place, and
Roy as his heir, and then, of course, follow the
path so many of his ancestors had done, with
dignity and unfaltering courage. Only in his
case it must be swift, he would never suffer
arrest.</p>

<h2>Chapter VII. <br> A Nameless Wife</h2>

<p>A terrible gale was blowing up the
Channel, and wise mariners made for port
before it was too late, while wives shuddered at
the howling whose menace they knew too well.</p>

<p>Off the South Coast a small French vessel was
beating its way against the blast, and
coast-guards looked with astonishment at its
manoeuvers, finally shrugging their shoulders at the
madness of the foreigner. Had they seen what
was taking place on the deck they would have
opened their eyes still wider.</p>

<p>The French skipper was holding to the rail,
shouting orders, while a madman, without hat or
coat, and with a set white face, was pointing a
pistol at his head.</p>

<p>“I tell you, sir,” said the shaking seaman, “we
dare not run in close to the shore, we shall be
driven in onto the rocks. It is sheer madness.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Reckavile calmly “lower a
boat and I will go ashore.”</p>

<p>The other made a gesture of despair. “It is
impossible, no boat would live for five minutes.
Why not let me run to shelter, or ride out the
storm?”</p>

<p>“I tell you I will not wait, though all Hell
were in the storm. You can choose, either you
lower a boat for me, or I shoot you.” His
calmness overawed the other.</p>

<p>“It is death, sir, for you, and perhaps for us
too.”</p>

<p>“The first is my affair, and the other is in the
hands of God or the Devil.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mon Dieu!” said the frightened man,
crossing himself. “Very well, since you will have
it so, and I will even go as near to the land as I
dare, though I am risking the lives of the crew.”</p>

<p>With a sense of relief he gave the order,
hoping that he might save his life and his vessel, by
casting this blasphemer.</p>

<p>And so Hugh, seventh Lord Reckavile went
to his death, driven by the Curse, and his body
bruised and broken but still recognisable, was
washed ashore by the old <i>Black Horse</i> at
Portham, and brought by the Southgates on a shutter
to the castle, while the storm shouted a requiem,
and the fiends seemed to be laughing at their last
effort at humour.</p>

<p>Winnie was summoned, for the news must be
broken, but it was dangerous in her condition, as
her time had almost come.</p>

<p>The butler in faltering accents, told her the sad
tidings.</p>

<p>She listened stony-eyed, and without tears.
The news stunned her. Much also as she thought
she loved him, his base desertion had cut her to
the quick, and his refusal to answer any letters
hurt her pride. She came and viewed the poor
relic, now decently laid out, and saw the quiet
beauty of the face, at rest at last, and peaceful.
Then the tears came, and she sobbed bitterly till
the nurse gently led her from the room,
reminding her that another life might depend on her
courage and restraint.</p>

<p>More to take her mind off the horror than for
any other reason the nurse placed into her hands
the sea-soaked contents of his pocket, and
Winnie idly examined them, her mind far removed
from the articles, and seeing only his flushed
handsome face, as she had last seen him alive.</p>

<p>A parcel, damp with sea water, and sticky to
the touch seized her attention, and she opened
the sheets of paper. The first words were
sufficient to rivet her mind on the writing.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Be it known to all that I Hugh Desmond, seventh
  Baron Reckavile, being of sound mind, wish, as
  far as lies in my power to make restitution for a
  great wrong which has been committed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As she read on, fear clutched her. The
document told of his marriage, and the birth of his
heir, and of his bigamy with Winnie. Enclosed
was the marriage certificate at the little village
of Steeping among the Sussex Downs.</p>

<p>The letters were blurred before her eyes.
Surely this must be hallucination. She
staggered as she read, and the quiet nurse came at
once to her aid, guiding her to the bed, where
she lay quivering.</p>

<p>The nurse gave one look at her, and went out
to summon the Doctor, after seeing that she
could be left safely.</p>

<p>Then all Winnie’s faculties came back, and
she was the fierce Mother fighting for her
offspring in some primeval forest.</p>

<p>She half rose, determined to destroy the
document before it could be seen by other eyes. That
must be done at all costs, but great waves of pain
came over her. She tried to rise, but could not.
Then as a cold numbness gripped her, she
grasped the packet in a despairing effort to
throw it into the brightly burning fire.</p>

<p>Delirium was coming on, and in the corner of
the room a formless shape was gathering, from
the sea-mist which pervaded the house. To her
startled imagination a dreadful shape emerged,
and the dead form of Hugh stood before her, the
face stern and grim, and the dead eyes gazing at
her in a fixed stare. Though no sound came
from the closed blue lids, she heard him say
“Destroy that paper, and the Curse will light on you.
I will give you no peace, nor your unborn son.
In sorrow and shame you shall bring forth a
nameless thing to bear my name and title.”</p>

<p>With a wild shriek, she sank back fainting on
the bed, as the nurse hurried into the room.</p>

<p>That night, the eighth Lord Reckavile was
born, with the mocking voice of the storm fiends
wailing round the old castle, and the very
foundations shaking with the fury of the tempest,
while in the Bay, gallant men were bringing half
drowned Frenchmen safe ashore from the wreck
of the vessel, and below a still form was lying
with a smile of devilish satisfaction on the dead
lips.</p>

<p>When Winnie, like a pallid ghost crept
downstairs for the first time, the nurse shook her head.</p>

<p>“She must have loved him very much to take
on so,” she said to the housekeeper.</p>

<p>But Winnie had one purpose in view. At all
costs the damning papers must be hidden,
destroy them she could not after the horrible vision,
even though her reason told her it was a
nightmare born of her condition. Hugh had told her
of the secret drawer of the Reckaviles, and she
placed the documents there.</p>

<p>“The villain,” she muttered “that accounts for
all his absences abroad, leading a double life, and
then trying to do my son out of his rights at the
end.” For black hatred had come to her of the
man who still haunted her in her dreams, and
more of the innocent girl and her son, far away
in Italy, who would hang like a dark cloud over
her son’s head for all his life. Truly the Curse
was heavy on the family.</p>

<p>And in Murano poor Carlotta awaited with
yearning anxiety for the man who would never
come back to her, and the weeks went on without
news. Bitter tears fell over that little cot, and
she would talk to the tiny mite lying there as
though he could understand, in baby language.
But the weeks went on, and her only friend was
Doctor Halley, who came with unfailing
regularity, always sympathetic and hopeful. She
grew to look for his visits, and if business kept
him, she became fretful. Time was taking its
toll with her, and sad lines came to her beautiful
face, which the doctor noticed with secret
anguish.</p>

<p>At last he came with a solemn look on his
usually cheerful face.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Desmond,” he said “I am afraid I have
some terrible news for you. You must try and
be brave.”</p>

<p>“He is dead,” she gasped with quick intuition.</p>

<p>“It is worse than that, I grieve to say.”</p>

<p>“Worse?”</p>

<p>He slowly unfolded an English paper, where
an account was given of the wreck, and the
drowning of Lord Reckavile.</p>

<p>It was of old date, but a print was given of the
dead man, and the likeness was unmistakable,
apart from the name below, “Hugh Desmond,
Lord Reckavile.”</p>

<p>At first she did not understand.</p>

<p>“It looks like Hugh,” she said in a hollow
voice. “It must be a relative.”</p>

<p>The Doctor shook his head. “I am afraid
there is no doubt,” he said gently “I never told
you, but on the night when your husband went
away, he dropped an envelope on the floor. I
picked it up from a sense of tidiness, intending
to throw it in the fire, when the name arrested
my hand. It was Lord Reckavile, and was part
of the letter he had opened in our presence, and
which had evidently disturbed him. There is no
doubt that it was his real name. He was Lord
Reckavile.”</p>

<p>A vague memory floated back to her mind.
The parson at their wedding had called him by
that name. She remembered the very words.</p>

<p>“ ‘Reckavile, you ruffian, this is the last straw!’
he had said.”</p>

<p>Even then she did not realise the full meaning
of the terrible news the doctor had brought.</p>

<p>Hugh was dead, and that stunned her for the
time, but Halley was speaking.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry to be the bearer of ill tidings,
but I felt you must be told. Poor little Roy. It
will be dreadful for him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” she replied wondering. How
would it matter when he was too young to
understand.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Desmond, you are a brave woman, I
know that. Don’t you see what this means.
Here is an account of the affair. Lady
Reckavile gave birth to a son and heir on the same
night.”</p>

<p>“Lady Reckavile!” she whispered. “You
mean he was married. He had a wife.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid so, he married you as Hugh
Desmond, having a wife already,” his voice was hard
and bitter.</p>

<p>She was up in arms at once. Every true
woman can so easily forgive a cruel wrong done her
if it is for Love.</p>

<p>“He loved me only, I am sure of that, and if
he had another wife, at any rate he left her for
me.”</p>

<p>The Doctor was wisely silent. The realisation
of the wrong done to the child upstairs would
come later.</p>

<p>“I have been so long away from England,”
he said “that I have lost touch with the people
there. I seem to have heard of the Reckaviles.”</p>

<p>It all came back to her when she lay on her
sleepless bed that night. His hesitation and the
delay in getting married, and then the secrecy,
and the hurried flight to Italy. Yes, it was all
clear now.</p>

<p>“Hugh, darling,” she said to herself,
condoning the wrong, in her great love as is the way
with a woman. “What you must have suffered.”
She never doubted his love for her, but she knew
vaguely that people in his station sometimes had
to make loveless marriages for social reasons.</p>

<p>All was black and hopeless, but she must live
on for her child’s sake. Relief came from the
parched fever when she bent over the cot where
the child lay, and a passionate flood of tears woke
the sleeping boy, and the need for comfort was
come. She rocked him in her arms, and sobbed
out her broken little heart. The good Doctor
was her one solace. With unselfish kindness he
saw her through this time of horror, and fought
inch by inch to help her forget. Each month an
allowance arrived from the lawyer in London
without explanation, for Hugh had arranged this
with Curtis, though the lawyer had no idea who
the lady was, and imagined it was one of
Reckavile’s past fancies, who had been pensioned off.</p>

<p>It was to continue during her lifetime, for at
the time there had been no thought of a further
contingency.</p>

<p>Halley had retired from practice, but lingered
on in Venice. When he thought suitable
interval had elapsed, he came suppliant to Carlotta,
his motives love and chivalry equally blended.</p>

<p>“I know you will never allow anyone to take
Hugh’s place,” he said humbly, “but you need
some one to protect you and help you to fight on.
I can only offer you my love, and I will devote
my life to you. But I fear I am hurting you.”</p>

<p>She had half risen with a look of horror on her
face, but sank back again.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand, Doctor, and you are
very kind, especially as you alone know how I
really am, a nameless wife, but you do not realise.
I am Italian, and I love but once. Whatever you
think of Hugh, I can never forget him and the
very thought of marrying again is like
committing a foul crime.”</p>

<p>Halley was one of those rare beings who can
love and sacrifice. Whatever he felt, no sign
appeared.</p>

<p>“Then you must allow me to be your protector
only,” he said, with a smile which hardly hid
his pain.</p>

<p>She was quick to see it. “You are a true friend,
and I am afraid I have hurt you horribly. Believe
me I do feel deeply for you, and am so grateful
for all you have done. Anything I can do to
return your friendship, I will do.” She stopped
there, and he understood.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch208">

<h2>Chapter VIII. <br> Roy at Oxford</h2>

<p>Doctor Halley grew old in his service
for Carlotta, ungrudging and without hope
of reward. His hair grew white, and the road to
Murano became heaviness to him, but he never
complained. As soon as the boy was old enough
he quietly took over his education, and watched
with growing anxiety the change that was taking
place in Carlotta.</p>

<p>She never referred to the past, but seemed to
live only for the child, and would gaze expectantly
down the garden path, as though she still
held a lingering hope. Her beauty paled, and
she was more and more withdrawing herself from
the world.</p>

<p>Halley grieved in secret, but his devotion was
deeper than admiration, and his loyal service
continued through these years.</p>

<p>Carlotta had written to the lawyers, asking
them what would happen to the child in the event
of her death, with regard to the allowance. Curtis
was dead, and she received a formal answer that
the sum paid was a personal grant and would
cease at her death.</p>

<p>So she lived as simply as possible, that Roy
should not go penniless when her time came, and
the Doctor was convinced that this fear more
than anything else kept her alive.</p>

<p>Roy was fifteen, a fine clean looking boy, with
his mother’s eyes and his father’s classical
beauty, untouched with his sardonic smile.
Halley had carefully taught him all he knew, which
was wide knowledge. Carlotta had insisted on
making Italian his mother tongue, and never
spoke English herself—if spoken to in that
language, would answer in Italian. She would also
write in Italian, and only once broke her
self-imposed edict, when she handed a miniature of
herself and the boy to Halley, under which she
had written “Mother and Roy.” Halley looked
at it in surprise, but she simply said, “In case
you ever meet him when I am gone.” The curious
doubt about her husband’s death distressed him,
but seemed to give her a strange comfort.</p>

<p>But her time had come; all Halley’s devotion
and medical skill availed nothing against her
broken heart, though there was no specific disease
that he could find. She was merely fading like a
flower after the summer is done. She called him
to her, while the boy was playing in the garden.</p>

<p>“My old and faithful friend, the best friend I
ever knew, the end has come, and you know it.
Don’t worry, it is all for the best. My loneliness
is such a torment, that only your great affection,
and Roy’s, could have made me stay so long. I
am going to ask of you one more service, as we
always do of those who have served only too well,
you will look after Roy, won’t you?”</p>

<p>The old Doctor’s head was bowed, and he did
not dare to show his face, he merely nodded, and
kneeling by her side, took her thin hand.</p>

<p>“I want you to see that he grows up an English
gentleman, as befits his birth,” she raised her
head proudly, as if in challenge.</p>

<p>“I will devote what remains of my life to him,”
said the old man simply.</p>

<p>She pressed his hand. “Thank you, I knew I
could rely on you, and you must tell him after I
have gone—you know—about his father. I could
not bear to do it. I should hate to see a look of
anger or loathing on his young face. You will
understand?”</p>

<p>“I will do it, you may trust to me,” he said in
a shaking voice.</p>

<p>“I am very tired, leave me now, but bring Roy
in presently, I must tell him I am going.”</p>

<p>Very reverently the Doctor took her hand, and
kissed it.</p>

<p>“You may kiss me now,” she said dreamily, “it
is all that I can give you.”</p>

<p>Halley rose from his knees, and the blinding
tears fell freely as he bent over that sweet face,
which he had loved so dearly without hope of
reward. He gently kissed her forehead, as one
might a little sleeping child, and hurried from
the room, for he knew the time was short. He
found the boy in the garden among the roses for
which he had all his mother’s passionate affection.</p>

<p>“Roy, my boy, you must be very brave as you
know an English gentleman should be. Your
mother is very ill, and you must go to her at
once, I am afraid she will not be very long with
us now.”</p>

<p>The boy turned pale. “Do you mean she is
going to die, Uncle?” he said in an awestruck
voice, face to face with the grim terror for the
first time in his life.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am afraid so, but it is in God’s hands.”</p>

<p>“But, you are a Doctor, can’t you do
something?” he protested with something of his
Father’s fiery impatience.</p>

<p>“It is because I am a Doctor that I know,”
was the quiet reply, “come we will go to her.”</p>

<p>But when they entered the room where she was
lying, another visitant had been there first, and
on her sweet face was an expression of such peace
as neither had seen before. It was as though the
long separation were over and a joyful reunion
had come.</p>

<p>“If ever a woman’s love can save a soul from
Hell, she has saved him,” said the Doctor in a
choking voice, kneeling reverently by the couch,
oblivious of the boy who stared at the face, so
quiet and lovely in death.</p>

<p>Then realisation came to him, with quick
intuition. The Doctor’s attitude and his bowed
head showed the truth more than spoken word,
and in a passion of grief, he flung himself beside
her.</p>

<p>“Mother! Mother! Don’t leave me, say
something—only speak! Don’t go without a word!”</p>

<p>The sound brought their old servant into the
room, and she and the Doctor gently led the
weeping boy away.</p>

<p>It was only after the last sad ceremony had been
carried out, and Michael and all the Archangels
had been invoked to bear this pure soul to the
feet of God, in the beautiful liturgy of the
Catholic service, that the two broken hearted mourners
came back to the villa, now hateful to both. In
time it would acquire a memory like a shrine, but
the loss was too near, too sudden, and it was
haunted with the dear ghost, which brought a
torture of longing. Halley saw this, and realised
that to a young boy change was essential. For
himself, he would have lingered on, dreaming of
her, and hoping that in some twilight evening, in
the hush before dark, a dream figure would come
down the rose garden, and touch his hand,
bidding him come to join her, and the man she had
loved so well, in a fairer Garden, where there is
no marrying nor giving in marriage, but where
they might be as the angels in Heaven.</p>

<p>It would never do for the boy to become
morbid, and so the broken man set himself to face
the future with a brave resolve.</p>

<p>“Roy, we must talk of the future. Your dear
mother left you in my hands, and I will do what
I can to make you a happy, and a good man. I
am going to take you to England, and we can
look out a good school, where you would like to
go, and meet other boys of your age, and play
games and win prizes.”</p>

<p>With a boy, sorrow can be deep, but not
overwhelming, and the thought of doing what he had
always longed for, as the Doctor knew, sent a
thrill of pleasure through him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle, how good of you! I have always
longed to see England, and should love to go to
one of the great public schools, I have read about.
And my father was English, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>The Doctor gave a start, for the boy had never
before asked about his father.</p>

<p>“How did you know that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Mother told me,” and the tears filled his eyes,
“you know when she signed that miniature. She
said she wrote in English because he was an
English gentleman, and she wanted me to grow
up like him.”</p>

<p>A grim smile played round the Doctor’s
mouth.</p>

<p>“Yes, Roy, he was English, and I will tell
you something. You are old enough to know
now, and your mother asked me to tell you.”</p>

<p>The boy stood eagerly waiting, and as the
Doctor looked at him, he realised something of
what the father must have looked when he too
was young, and he sighed.</p>

<p>“Your father was Lord Reckavile,” he said
slowly.</p>

<p>“Lord Reckavile?” exclaimed the boy, “then
I am …” and he stopped, for something in the
Doctor’s sad old eyes frightened him. “But my
mother’s name was Desmond, as mine is?” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was Lord Reckavile’s family name.
Oh, you must not think evil of your sainted
mother. She married him, thinking he was plain
Mr. Desmond.”</p>

<p>“And he was Lord Reckavile all the time?”
asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Yes Roy,” said the old man taking the boy’s
hand in his. “But he was married in England
before he met your mother. There was a Lady
Reckavile. Your poor mother did not know,
until he was drowned.”</p>

<p>A terrible look came into the boy’s eyes, the
Reckavile look.</p>

<p>He was not too young to understand.</p>

<p>“You mean to tell me that he married my
mother when he had another wife alive,” he said
slowly. Halley had no wish to shield the man,
but the memory of Carlotta’s sweet face made
him say:</p>

<p>“He loved your mother only, you must not
judge your father too harshly. People in his
position are sometimes forced to marry, against
their wills, but I am sure it was your dear mother
he loved.”</p>

<p>The boy stiffened, he had suddenly grown up.</p>

<p>“He was a villain, and I hate him—hate him!
I am glad he died. If he had lived I would have
killed him.”</p>

<p>Here was a Reckavile indeed. His eyes blazed,
and Halley understood why Carlotta had not
told him; she knew her son.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood with fists clenched,
then he collapsed and a bitter flood of tears came.</p>

<p>“Go away,” he said fiercely as Halley tried to
comfort him. “I want to be left alone.”</p>

<p>In the evening when the shadows were stretching
over the garden, and a chill mist was coming
up from the sea, the boy came in with a set face,
hard and proud.</p>

<p>“Uncle Halley,” he said firmly, “I want to go
to England, let’s go at once, as soon as possible, I
want you to let me take your name. If you are
looking after me, let me be Roy Halley. Do you
mind?”</p>

<p>The Doctor understood the proud young heart
of the boy.</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” he said “nothing would please
me better. You were left to me, and I have only
you to look after in my old age. You shall bear
my name and be my adopted son.”</p>

<p>The boy threw his head up.</p>

<p>“Then I shall call you ‘Father,’ and I will try
and forget the hated name of Desmond, which
never was my mother’s. You are the only father
I have ever known,” and he came and kissed the
old man with the sweet grace of his mother.</p>

<p>They went to England, when everything had
been settled up.</p>

<p>The villa Halley could not bear to let or sell;
he arranged for the old servant to live there with
a small pension for her needs. Halley paid everything
himself, and retained Carlotta’s savings for
the boy against his need.</p>

<p>Time works miracles with the young, and Roy
in the glories and the struggles of life at a public
school, soon retained only a hallowed memory of
his mother, and refused to let his mind dwell on
the other horror.</p>

<p>At Oxford his voice and acting first became
noticeable. He was much in request for his
playing and singing, and was looked upon as a
promising amateur actor. His easy grace of manner,
and the recklessness of his spending, due not to
extravagance, but to the family tradition which
spoke loud in him, made him a general favourite,
and he was no mean athlete, which in the glorious
days of the varsity, counts for more than brains
or money.</p>

<p>In his third year he was occupying a position
which perhaps never comes again to a man. In
the little kingdom of his college he was a small
god. In after life men hold great positions, but
then disillusionment has come and the freshness
of youth has gone.</p>

<p>In his college team at most games, and playing
for his varsity at rugger, as his father had
before, if only it had been known, and with a
force of character welcomed and admired everywhere,
no wonder if he lost himself in the celsitude
of his power. But the high gods will not
suffer such happiness, and in the middle of the
dream came an awakening. A telegram to tell
him that Doctor Halley had passed away in his
sleep brought him up to reality.</p>

<p>In bitter sorrow he went to London where the
old man had taken up his residence. From the
first he had determined not to commit the mistake
of living at Oxford or near it. He wanted the
boy to enjoy life there unfettered by visits of a
relation, and he chose London, so that the boy
should be able to come to him in the ‘vacs,’ and
have plenty of amusement. He effaced himself
for the son, as he had for the mother. He knew
his heart was very weak, but kept the knowledge
from Roy, lest he should distress him.</p>

<p>And so his peaceful end came, his duty done,
and his great chivalrous soul went to join her,
whose image was never absent from his mind.
Roy’s journey was a terrible ordeal of self-blame.
He saw how selfish he had been, how little
he had repaid the great debt. He recalled with
the acute self-analysis of a sensitive mind all the
times when he had studied his own fancies, and
left the old man alone, when he should have been
with him, looking after him. And now it was too
late. More than all remorse filled him when he
found that the old man had been meeting all his
extravagant expenses, by selling out his own
money, and that the sum his mother had saved,
not large, but which had grown with the years,
was still intact.</p>

<p>He went back to his college a changed man.
The old gaiety had gone, and a bitter self-scorn
had come which brought out something of the old
Reckavile spirit. Women he shunned with
horror, as the image of the one perfect woman he
had known made the others seem hollow, and
talkative beyond measure.</p>

<p>He plunged into wild ‘rags,’ which brought
him before the Warden, and drink to which he
had never turned, threatened to make shameful
his career.</p>

<p>And then the gods relented, and the cloud of
War settled on the land. To Roy it was like a
call to his own kingdom. Others born of
generations of peaceful citizens took arms with sober
patriotism, as a duty which must not be shirked,
but to him generations of fighters called, with
exultant shouting. Death! What did that
matter! The only two he had ever loved were on the
Other Side, and he wished nothing better than to
pass over to them.</p>

<p>For glorious years he lived at grips with death,
first as a private in the muddy trenches, and later
with a commission, known as a reckless patrol
leader, and a born fighter. He might have risen
high in that Hell’s academy where such qualities
mean promotion, but in ’16 he was smashed by a
bomb and his wrecked body only mended in time
for the final advance.</p>

<p>When Peace came, he heard around him the
officers joyously discussing a return to civil life,
and of all that they were going to do. Some were
going to wives or sweethearts, one talked of his
job at the bank which he hoped was still open to
him. To Roy, it was an end of a mighty
adventure. There was nothing to look forward to, but
a bare struggle to live. He had no friends, no
welcoming smile to greet him.</p>

<p>He knew that for the Nation it was a
wonderful day of rejoicing, but to him nothing
remained.</p>

<p>Another year in the wildest parts of Russia
kept his spirit cheerful, and then he returned to
demobilisation.</p>

<p>He had not the heart to go back to Oxford,
but sought for some form of employment, where
excitement and feverish activity could give
forgetfulness.</p>

<p>His knowledge of languages, a tuneful voice,
and his natural charm secured for him successive
jobs in travelling companies in Europe, where in
gilt and motley he sung in choruses in grand and
comic opera, till fate drove him back to England,
and to a small part in a travelling company of
Gilbert and Sullivan’s operas. It was all
hopeless, and he felt that he had only to wait till a
merciful death ended the life which had become
distasteful to him.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch209">

<h2>Chapter IX. <br> A Ghost from the Past</h2>

<p>Coming from the theatre after a matinee,
along the Strand, Roy was making his way
to an obscure restaurant where food was
comparatively cheap, when he nearly collided with
two men hastening round the corner. The wind
was bitter, and rain was falling, so that all the
men had coats closely buttoned and collars
turned up.</p>

<p>Roy muttered an apology, and would have
passed on, but one of the two seeing his face in
the light, suddenly drew back, and exclaimed
“By God, Reckavile, by all that’s unholy. I did
not know that you were in England again. How
are you, old thing?” and he held out his hand. A
wild fantasy whirled before Roy’s mind, and for
a moment he was without sense or speech, then
he said coldly.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you have made a mistake, sir; my
name is not Reckavile.”</p>

<p>The other scrutinised him closely.</p>

<p>“No, by Jove, you’re not. I am sorry, but look,
Raymond, what a likeness!”</p>

<p>Roy’s anger was rising, he was not a waxwork
to be inspected, and he turned to go his way, but
the first speaker caught his coat.</p>

<p>“No, sir, you must not go like that, I have
been rude enough to address you by mistake, but
I will make amends if I may. Will you come to
my Club, if you will do us the honour, and let me
apologise in suitable manner for having taken
you for one of the worst blackguards, but the
most charming of men.”</p>

<p>Roy could not well refuse a request so politely
put, and curiosity goaded him on, so he went with
his chance companions, Sir Raymond Halliday,
and Captain John Wynter, son of the Late Brig.
General Wynter V.C. who had perished at Loos.</p>

<p>In the smoking room of the Club, Roy
unthawed. The atmosphere was more to his liking
than the dressing room of a travelling company,
and he felt at home with these men.</p>

<p>They were soon discussing old days at the war,
and exchanging yarns of people and places
where they had met for a brief moment, and then
gone down the long trail. To Roy it all came
back; the nights he had come back from a little
frolic at Etaire, where real oysters could be had,
and <i>Veuve Cliquot</i> 1904, a change from trench
fare, and then a ride back to the trenches with
the ominous line of Verey lights marking the
enemy lines, and the sudden whirl of a “heavy”
coming over, mingled with the flickering rat-tat
of the machine guns.</p>

<p>How real it all seemed and how desirable in
the warm firelight of the smoking room.</p>

<p>Presently Raymond broke silence.</p>

<p>“You are not a relation of the Reckaviles, Mr.
Halley, are you? Excuse the rudeness of the
question but you are extraordinarily like him.”</p>

<p>“None whatever,” said Roy firmly.</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it, eh Wynter?” said
Raymond.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s not a pleasant family, so Mr.
Halley is well out of it. You know my father was
mixed up with that affair, the Reckavile Divorce
they called it, though it was really the Wheatland
Divorce.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was too young to remember,” said
Raymond carelessly, but Roy was all attention.</p>

<p>“What was that?” he asked, steadying his
voice.</p>

<p>“Old Reckavile, the father of this Johnny, got
mixed up with a draper’s wife, and the worthy
man didn’t like it and got a divorce. The joke
was that Reckavile offered to fight for the girl,
and properly put the wind up the draper. Well,
he did what’s called the right thing, and married
her, my father was at the wedding, and a pretty
thick time it was from all accounts but he never
settled down with the lady, he buzzed off
somewhere and got killed or something, I forget
how.”</p>

<p>Roy was now on wires, but he showed nothing,
his training on the stage served him in good
stead.</p>

<p>“When was that?” he asked, lighting a cigar
with studied care.</p>

<p>“I can never remember dates,” said the other
“about thirty years ago I should say at a guess,
but you’ll find it all in the old papers, if it
interests you. We keep them upstairs, but no one
ever looks at them. Here, I am sorry we are
going dry, touch that bell will you?”</p>

<p>The rest of the evening passed like a dream till
Roy rose to get back to the theatre for the
evening performance, but though he sang and
played his part, his mind was disturbed with
thoughts which would intrude on him, and the
old memories he had stifled rose to mock him.
He knew he would have no peace till he had read
that long dead story. His friends had asked him
to come again, and he took them at their word
at the risk of being a bore.</p>

<p>In the musty reading room, seldom visited by
the members of this joyous Club, he found the
old copies, with the help of a spectacled librarian,
who seemed detached from the world without
and only en rapport with his yellowing tomes.</p>

<p>He showed Roy the files in which the sordid
story was told, but only one line stood out in
letters of burning fire, the date at the head of the
paper. That was damning and convincing.
Nothing could alter that, and while his eyes were
reading the account of the affair, his mind saw
only one deadly fact, that the date was after the
marriage of Reckavile with his mother. This
overwhelmed him so utterly that he could hardly
thank the old man, and hurry from the place.
His mind was in a whirl. There must be some
mistake, the marriage, must have been illegal or
something; he could not grasp a deliberate cold
blooded bigamy; he would dismiss it from his
mind. Why had this spectre from the past come
to torment him? It would be quite simple. To
settle the matter he would go to Somerset House,
and pay the fee for inspection, and lay the ghost.</p>

<p>As he expected after a long search he failed to
find any reference to the marriage. He little
knew the reason, or the sudden death of the
parson, before he had been able to send the record
for registration. But it was sufficient, and he
plunged back into his work determined to
dismiss the whole thing from his mind.</p>

<p>But the maggot was gnawing at his brain, and
the old restlessness came on him. He would go
abroad, but something drew him to the home of
his ancestors; he must see Portham, and
Reckavile Castle, before he finally turned his back on
England.</p>

<p>Wynter and Raymond were now fast friends,
caught with his charm which never failed to
captivate.</p>

<p>“After all you have told me about Reckavile,
I am going to have a look at the place,” he said
one night at dinner.</p>

<p>Wynter’s usually jolly face became grave. “I
shouldn’t if I were you,” he said “you know half
the people there will take you for Reckavile, and
there may be unpleasant things said.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked the other sharply.</p>

<p>“Well, you know old man, when a commoner
bears a striking resemblance to a peer of the
Realm, especially to one with such a reputation,
unpleasant things are said, which I know you
would resent. Do you get me?”</p>

<p>“Quite,” said Roy, swallowing his anger with
difficulty, and he said no more.</p>

<p>When the run of the series of revivals was
over, and he was free, Roy refused to re-engage,
to the disappointment of the manager, and the
company.</p>

<p>“I was hoping, Mr. Halley, to give you the
leading tenor in our Number I Touring
Company,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I am most grateful, but I am
going abroad,” Halley replied.</p>

<p>And so he came at last to Portham, and fate
drove him to the <i>Black Horse</i>, kept by
Southgate, grizzled and seaworn, who alone knew the
truth, though not the whole truth.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch210">

<h2>Chapter X. <br> At the “Black Horse”</h2>

<p>Halley knocked at the door of the <i>Black
Horse</i> and Mrs. Southgate opened to him.
He raised his hat politely, saying “Have you a
room here I could have for a few days?”</p>

<p>She looked at him dubiously. “We don’t take
in people as a rule, sir, you see it is hard to get
things out here.”</p>

<p>Then seeing how tired he looked, she added,
“I’ll go and ask my husband.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I have walked from Portham
Junction with this bag.”</p>

<p>He entered and sat down in the kitchen, and
gazed round with interest at the old room.</p>

<p>From the inside quarters he heard the sound
of a conversation, and presently the landlord
emerged with a scowl on his face.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, sir,” he began, and stopped dead.
His jaw dropped, and he looked in amazement
at Halley. “I beg your pardon, my … Oh
Lord! Who are you?”</p>

<p>“My name is Halley, and I asked your good
wife if you could put me up for a few days, I
shall be very little trouble.”</p>

<p>The landlord stood with a puzzled look on his
face.</p>

<p>“I’m darned if I understand it,” he muttered
“are you sure you are not playing a joke on me,
my lord, I could have sworn …”</p>

<p>“For whom did you take me, then?”</p>

<p>“Why, Lord Reckavile, you’re ’is living
image.”</p>

<p>Halley smiled. “I am sure you can
accommodate me, even though I am not Lord Reckavile.”</p>

<p>“Why yes, sir, if you don’t mind roughing it
a bit; we are plain folk.”</p>

<p>So the bargain was struck, but Halley noticed
that every time the landlord came in he fixed his
eyes on him in the same bewildered fashion.</p>

<p>When he had set the table for a simple lunch
in the old timbered room Halley asked casually:</p>

<p>“Who is this Lord Reckavile for whom you
took me? I should like to see him.”</p>

<p>“You must be a stranger in these parts; why,
’is Lordship ’as a place near ’ere, Reckavile
Castle.”</p>

<p>“And is he here now?” Halley asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, ’e is ’ardly ever at ’ome, but we expect
’im as ’e comes about this time as a rule.”</p>

<p>“I must have a look at this castle then, it ought
to be an interesting place.”</p>

<p>Southgate cast a shrewd glance at his visitor.</p>

<p>“I dunno if you ’ad better,” he said sullenly
“they be ’ard on poachers there; no, I shouldn’t
go if I were you.”</p>

<p>Halley stretched himself before the fire while
Southgate cleared away.</p>

<p>He thought it peculiar that he should do this
himself, instead of getting a servant to perform
the office, but when he had finished he came and
stood beside Halley’s chair, fidgetting
awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Sit down, landlord, and join me with
something if you can spare the time,” said Halley
taking a sudden resolve.</p>

<p>“Thank you kindly, sir, I don’t mind if I do.
Things be powerful quiet nowadays, except in
the evenings there be nothing doing.”</p>

<p>When he had fetched a bottle and glasses,
Halley turned to him, and asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“Will you answer me a straight question?”</p>

<p>“If I can, sir.”</p>

<p>“I believe you acted as valet to the late Lord
Reckavile many years ago?”</p>

<p>The landlord’s face set like a mask.</p>

<p>“I may ’ave done,” he said evasively.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you plain and straight, were
you present at his marriage to his <em>first</em> wife, an
Italian lady with whom he had eloped.”</p>

<p>Southgate leapt to his feet with a snarl.</p>

<p>“What do you want to know?”</p>

<p>“Sit down, please, I will tell you. I am his
son, born in Italy, and she was my mother—now
you know.”</p>

<p>Southgate covered his head with his hands, and
something like a sob escaped him.</p>

<p>“My God! If I ’ad only known,” he cried.</p>

<p>He remained so long silent that Halley could
stand it no more.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said.</p>

<p>“To think that Miss Carlotta ’ad a son. I tell
’ee sir, afore God, that if I ’ad known I would
’ave spoken. When ’is Lordship was drownded
trying to land at this very spot, and the present
lord was born the same night, I didn’t know
what to do, I thought as ’ow poor Miss Carlotta
must be dead. It seemed no good saying
anything and getting into trouble, and not being
believed, so I thought I best let matters bide, and
if she were alive, she would come along; but time
went and nothing ’appened, so I just kept quiet.
When I saw you come in that ’ere door, I
thought you was ’is Lordship, and then I
suppose I must ’ave guessed. You are like ’im, but
also like your mother, poor sweet young lady!”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Halley gently “I cannot
blame you. It was a difficult position. But tell
me, where was my mother married?”</p>

<p>“I wish I could say, sir, indeed I do. That
was one reason why I kept quiet. You see we
’urried off from ’ere as was always ’is way, and
travelled to Dover. I didn’t know anything
about the wedding till we stops at a village. It
was such a rush, and we all ’ad as much as we
could carry. I may ’ave ’eard the name, but I’ve
clean forgot it.”</p>

<p>Halley groaned.</p>

<p>“And this was before he married—the late
Lady Reckavile?”</p>

<p>Halley stuck over the title.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes sir, for I remember them all coming
down after the wedding, and of course, I thought
poor Miss Carlotta was dead. But why didn’t
you come before, sir?”</p>

<p>There was a note of suspicion in his tone, which
Halley noticed, and he told him as much of his
story as he thought expedient.</p>

<p>“Well this be a pretty mess,” said Southgate
“what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I must see Lord Reckavile, but I cannot stay
here after what you have told me about the
likeness. Can you find somewhere for me to go until
Lord Reckavile comes back?”</p>

<p>Southgate smoked in silence for some minutes,
at last he said:</p>

<p>“I was allers fond of the old master wild as ’e
was, and your mother was a sweet young thing.
Lady Reckavile I never could abide…. I
got a cottage on the shore, we sometimes uses for
… well least said the better, and we
sometimes lets it in the summer. You can go there
if you don’t mind things rough, tomorrow. Mrs.
Southgate can look after you.”</p>

<p>Halley took the other’s hand gratefully.</p>

<p>“This is most good of you, and I hope one day
I may be able to repay you.”</p>

<p>The landlord was embarrassed. “I don’t see
why you should be a done out of your rights, but
you’ll ’ave a tough time with Lord Reckavile;
’ese a nasty customer to get foul of.”</p>

<p>“Only let me know when he comes back, and
I’ll see him.”</p>

<p>The next day Halley moved to the lonely little
cottage on the shore. Its isolation and the
numerous entrances gave a hint as to its use for
revenue dodging purposes in the old days, but
he was glad of any place of refuge for his tell-tale
face, and with the issues at stake. For days
he waited consumed with feverish impatience.
Now that he had come so far he was determined
to see the thing through, regardless of
consequences.</p>

<p>At last when his nerves were nearly gone,
Southgate came with the momentous news that
Lord Reckavile had come home.</p>

<p>They sat long over the fire in converse.
Halley now had Southgate as a willing slave, who
would follow him to the death, and a plan was
arranged between them.</p>

<p>“We must try and see whether we can get an
interview with him privately,” said Halley.</p>

<p>“We must not delay matters, for ’e is off like
a flash,” said the other “it’s almost as though ’e
was afeared to stay long.”</p>

<p>“Tonight, then,” said Halley.</p>

<h2>Chapter XI. <br> Halley Continues the Narrative</h2>

<p>There was silence in the room after
Halley had told his story, in fewer words than
are given here. Not a sound had broken the
stillness and all eyes had been fixed on him, as
part at least of the truth was revealed.</p>

<p>Halley looked round at his audience. Ena’s
eyes were wet, and she had furtively used her
handkerchief from time to time, but there shone
on her face the light of enthusiasm and trust.
Fletcher was obviously incredulous, and Brown
stolid as ever.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by Sefton.</p>

<p>“So you are really Lord Reckavile?” he asked.</p>

<p>“In actual fact I am, but I cannot establish
my title. I am a nameless man, unless by some
miracle the marriage certificate is found—if it
still exists, or we can find the village church
where the wedding took place.”</p>

<p>“That should not be impossible,” said Sinclair
in a firm voice, and Ena looked at him
gratefully.</p>

<p>“Finish the story, Lord Reckavile,” he
continued, and the very use of the title suggested
something hidden in that inscrutable mind.</p>

<p>“There is little more to tell,” said Halley.
“Southgate and I tried to get to the castle after
dark, and prowled around, but we were chased
by a constable,” and he laughingly threw a
glance at Brown.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was it, was it?” Brown spluttered
without regard to grammar. “So you were the
two I were after. I thought Southgate was one
of them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so after that I lost patience, and
determined to call at the castle whatever the risk. I
went boldly to the front door. Lord Reckavile
never seemed to leave the place, or I would have
tried to waylay him on the road. Giles opened
the door for me.”</p>

<p>“You never mentioned a word of this, Giles,”
said Fletcher angrily.</p>

<p>“Lord Reckavile’s callers were none of my
business,” said the old man slowly. Fletcher
was about to say something but Sinclair stopped
him with a gesture.</p>

<p>“Giles showed me in,” Halley continued, “and
I shall never forget Reckavile’s face when he
saw me. He went deathly white, and his lip
curled back and back like a wolf about to snarl,
but no sound came from his lips. We stood and
stared at each other in absolute silence.</p>

<p>“The likeness was so striking that it was
almost as though I was looking into a glass. The
strong Reckavile strain has risen salient and
complete in spite of our mothers, though I was
darker and had a touch of Italian if one had
looked closely.</p>

<p>“He seemed to recover himself, and turned to
Giles.</p>

<p>“ ‘You can leave us,’ he said, and the old man
went out of the room.</p>

<p>“Then he turned to me, and his face was hardly
human. ‘Hast thou found me, oh mine enemy!’
he hissed. He never seemed to have the least
doubt as to who I was. Poor fellow! The
thought of my coming had haunted him like a
nightmare, and driven him to furious
wanderings. He was like a man under sentence of
death, who was leading feverish years, not
knowing at any time that the grim spectre would
appear. So much he told me. His mother had
confided the whole story to him on her death bed,
and adjured him to keep the document which
would mean his undoing should I ever appear.
His life must have been hell on earth.</p>

<p>“He listened to my story without a word, but
I could see that his mind was working all the
time to devise a plan, and I knew I was in
imminent peril. At the end he rose and paced the
room. ‘You must give me time to think,’ he said,
‘I shall want the fullest proofs of your identity
before I can say anything. Come and see me
tomorrow night, at eight o’clock. Don’t come to
the front door, I will have the French windows
open for you.’ He let me out by the window,
and I went to my cottage, half inclined to throw
up the whole thing and go away. I was sorry
for him, and it was only the thought of all that
my mother had suffered that kept me to my
purpose.</p>

<p>“I told Southgate nothing, as I had involved
him quite enough. The next night I kept the
appointment, I will confess in some trepidation,
he had been so calm, so self-possessed, that I felt
he had something behind it all. I found the
window open and went in. The room was in
semi-darkness.</p>

<p>“Reckavile did not offer to shake hands, but
started at once in a voice of intolerable insolence.
‘Mr. Halley,’ he said ‘I have been considering
your story, and congratulate you on your powers
of invention. In any ordinary case I should
simply send for the police and have you arrested on
a charge of blackmail, but there are so many
reasons for wishing to avoid a public scandal or
digging up the past that I offer you a handsome
sum, let us say 10,000 pounds, if you will take
yourself off, and never come to England again.’</p>

<p>“For the moment I was going to leap at him,
and take him by the throat, but some curious
instinct held me back. In a flash I saw what his
game was. He wished for some reason to
provoke me to attack him. Perhaps then he could
have killed me, and pleaded self-defence. He
may have had witnesses for all I knew.
Anyway I kept my temper. ‘Give me the marriage
certificate of my mother’ I said, and I pulled out
the miniature I had always carried with me.
‘That is her picture with me as a child’ I said.
‘It is her honour I am concerned with.
Otherwise I would leave you alone with your title.’</p>

<p>“ ‘Wait a moment’ he said, and walked across
the room to the cabinet containing the
dictaphone there.”</p>

<p>Halley paused and pointed to the object, on
which all eyes were fixed.</p>

<p>“ ‘You will take my offer?’ he asked. I
noticed a curious clicking sound, but at the time
thought nothing of it, it was only afterwards it
came back to my mind, and the significance
dawned on me. ‘You are trying to insult me,’
I said, and I am afraid I lost control of myself.</p>

<p>“ ‘Sign a document to say that your mother
never married my father, and the money is
yours,’ he said and smiled at me like a devil.</p>

<p>“ ‘Curse you’ I said advancing to him ‘I don’t
want your dirty money; I only want justice and
my rights.’</p>

<p>“ ‘Over my dead body’ he cried, and even at
that moment it seemed that the words were
theatrical, as though spoken for some purpose,
but I was too far gone for thinking and I sprang
for him. I can see now that he had been waiting
for me, and a crashing blow descended on my
head, bringing me to the ground. I rose,
pouring with blood, and flew at him, and we grappled
together, but loss of blood, and the shock were
too much for me, and I suppose I must have
fainted.</p>

<p>“When I recovered, I found Reckavile
bending over me, surprisingly gentle, and full of
apologies.</p>

<p>“ ‘I am sorry, my dear fellow’ he said ‘but you
know you attacked me first, I hope you are
better.’</p>

<p>“I murmured something, I suppose I was
lightheaded, but he helped me to the sofa, and
then to my intense surprise he said ‘You are
knocked up tonight, but if you can get away
without assistance it will save a scandal, and
come tomorrow night at seven. Here is the
marriage certificate, and you shall have it then.’ He
walked to that desk, and pulled it out and showed
it. If I had not been so weak I should have
snatched it from him, but he held it away from
me, with a mocking smile. ‘I swear that you shall
be restored to your rights tomorrow’ he said, ‘but
meanwhile not a word about tonight.’</p>

<p>“I gave my word, and at last was able to totter
out of the room, and by slow stages to get home.</p>

<p>“The next day I spent in bed, but in the
afternoon I walked to Bungalow Town as my head
was splitting, and I had to think the whole thing
out. I was sure there was some trap but could
not fathom the plot. You know the rest. The
wound broke open, and I nearly fainted. Mr.
Sefton here found me in a broken condition, and
bound me up at the Club. I staggered down to
the <i>Black Horse</i>. By doing so I was too late to
keep my appointment and I saved my neck from
the halter,” he added gravely.</p>

<p>“You mean that had you gone to the castle,
you would have been accused of the murder,”
said Sefton.</p>

<p>“I believe he had planned the whole thing with
diabolical cunning. When I read the account of
the murder I recognised at once that the
conversation heard by Giles and Brown was the one
which took place the night before, and guessed a
dictaphone, which had caused the ticking sound
I had heard. He had arranged for me to come,
and either was going to commit suicide, which is
the Reckavile way, with damning evidence
against me, or to bolt, in which case I should
certainly have been arrested, and exposed to
ignominy and degradation, though without the
body they could not prove murder. There would
be my footmarks and probably my presence, and
the conversation, though how he would have
disposed of the record without an accomplice I
cannot say.”</p>

<p>“I begin to see light,” said Fletcher “then I
suppose you and Southgate came to try and find
the certificate?”</p>

<p>“And the record, yes. I came first by myself,
and when hiding in the house came across some
old costumes, and wigs, and being as you know,
an actor, I had no difficulty in disguising myself
as old Reckavile. As you all saw the family
likeness was striking, and I thought that if
anyone saw me they would take me for a ghost.”</p>

<p>“So that was it?” said Fletcher.</p>

<p>“It was not hard to guess,” said Sinclair with
a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“Then my good friend Southgate came with
me, and we were nearly caught by Brown,” and
Halley laughed.</p>

<p>“You caught me properly, sir,” said the
rueful constable.</p>

<p>“You see, I was afraid that Reckavile had
destroyed the document, but as he had kept it all
those years for some queer superstition, and as
I had seen him put it into the desk, I thought it
was worth while trying to find it. It was my
only chance, Southgate most loyally helped me.
Is there any more to explain?”</p>

<p>Fletcher moved restlessly. “All this is most
interesting, but I don’t see that we are any
nearer to a solution. In fact you seem to have
incriminated yourself. After all, we cannot get
over the fact that the dead man was found with
a knife in his back, and the windows fast shut
instead of wide open as they should have been
from your account.”</p>

<p>Sinclair fixed his gaze on Fletcher. “I think
you had better wait,” he said “we have not done
yet.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch212">

<h2>Chapter XII. <br> The Secret Out</h2>

<p>“I don’t see that we are any further
towards the solution of the murder,” said
Fletcher. “All that we have heard sheds no light
on the actual crime at all.”</p>

<p>Sinclair remained for a moment in thought,
then he said slowly, and with great deliberation,
his eyes fixed on vacancy.</p>

<p>“Will the murderer confess?”</p>

<p>The sunlight outside seemed to accentuate the
grim horror within, it was here that the crime
had been committed, and the shadow of the dead
man was almost visible to their eyes of
imagination. Sinclair waited, and in that pause a chill
feeling of fear made manifest seemed to pervade
the room. In utter silence he waited, then in
sharp, incisive words he said “Very well, then we
must take extreme measures. Mr. Cook, will
you please explain exactly what happened when
you came here to see Lord Reckavile on the day
of the murder?”</p>

<p>The wretched man seemed to crumple into a
heap.</p>

<p>“Me, sir,” he stammered, his face like chalk.
“Oh, God, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, and gripped the back of
his chair for support. The police officers looked
at him with that gaze of proprietorship which
they keep for a prospective candidate for the
gallows. Brown was unconsciously wondering
what length of drop would be required for him,
and Andrews was wondering whether he had a
pair of handcuffs to fit.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sinclair, “don’t stand there
saying nothing. You came and saw Lord Reckavile
on the afternoon of the murder, that we
know—what happened?”</p>

<p>“It is true that I came to him, and gave him
his ground rents, as I have always done, but I
swear to God that I simply took my receipt and
went, I did not even come into this room. I saw
him in the hall. That is why I never mentioned
it before, I was afraid of being accused of the
murder. I was only here a few minutes, Giles
knows that don’t you?” and he looked wildly at
the old butler.</p>

<p>Giles spoke slowly, evidently under deep
emotion.</p>

<p>“May I say a word, sir,” he said to Sinclair.</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“You asked just now who killed Lord
Reckavile—I did.”</p>

<p>If a bombshell had exploded in the room there
could not have been a greater sensation.</p>

<p>“At last,” said Sinclair, and there was a note
of triumph in his voice. “Thank you, Giles.
That is what we wanted. Mr. Cook, I offer you
a profound apology for the bad moment we gave
you, but it was the only way to get a confession
from him. That was why the whole meeting was
arranged. It was Mr. Halley’s idea, and you
know he has been on the stage.”</p>

<p>Then turning sternly to Giles, he said. “I
have to warn you that anything you say may be
used as evidence against you, but I know most
of the story, and I do think a frank confession
is your best chance.”</p>

<p>“I have no desire to keep anything back, nor
do I regret what I have done. An hour ago I
wanted to live for one thing, to complete what
I had begun, but after what I have heard of all
the suffering of Mr. Halley and his mother, that
desire has gone.”</p>

<p>“But we are all in the dark …” began
Fletcher.</p>

<p>“You shall know,” said Sinclair. “First, Giles
is not his name; he once bore another, is that not
so, Mr. Wheatland?”</p>

<p>Giles started. “That is so, though how you
know it I cannot guess. I am an old man, and
I know my days are numbered, so I do not care
what happens to me. They can hang me if they
like, though I am sorry for Mrs. Giles for she
has been a good wife to me.</p>

<p>“Well, here is my story. Mr. Sinclair has told
you my real name. After the shame and
disgrace of the divorce, and the loss of my wife,
whom I loved dearly,” his voice broke for a
moment, “I lived for one thing only, to be revenged
on the man who had robbed me. I was too much
of a coward to fight him, but when he married
Winnie and then deserted her, I swore to kill
him. My business went to pieces, and I seemed
to lose heart in it. I sold it up, and brooded
over my wrongs. Then I determined to destroy
the last of this accursed breed, and waited for
him to come to England, and the next thing I
heard was that he had been drowned. That
would have ended it for me, but Winnie had a
son, and I determined that the whole hated race
should come to an end, for the blood was rotten.
I waited and watched for years, and at last I
heard that Winnie was dying, and hurried down
to see her.</p>

<p>“She hardly knew me at first, but when she
recognised me she was overjoyed, and clung to
me to the last, imploring my pardon for the
wrong she had done me. I will not dwell on
that, it is too sacred, but she confided to me the
dread secret of the other Reckavile, who was
somewhere in the world for all she knew, and
might turn up at any time to dispossess her son.
I could hardly hide my delight when I heard of
the tortures he was enduring, hunted through the
world by the thought of that other, but I soothed
her last hours, and then set myself to thought.
What was the good of killing this Reckavile and
leaving the other alive. I wished to destroy them
both.”</p>

<p>The madness of the old man was plainly in his
eyes, and Ena drew away, sick with horror.</p>

<p>“I carefully trained myself as a butler, and
obtained the post here without much difficulty.
It was a sinecure, as Reckavile was nearly always
abroad.</p>

<p>“All those years I waited. I could have killed
him at any time, but then the thought of the
other brother coming forward and perhaps
gloating over me at my trial stayed my hand. I knew
somehow my chance would come, and at last it
did. Southgate and I were old friends, and I
heard of the stranger who had come to the <i>Black
Horse</i>. Mrs. Southgate told me about him, and
from the description I had no doubt as to his
identity. I knew he was hidden away
somewhere, and Southgate had asked me to let him
know when Lord Reckavile came back. How
little he realised what he was asking! I found
the thought of my hour of triumph coming at
last, and everything seemed to play into my
hands, as though Fate or the Reckavile Curse
was taking a part. I brought Mr. Halley in to
Lord Reckavile, and the sight of his face was
like wine to me. Already I was having my
revenge, and it was sweet. I heard some of their
conversation, though not all.</p>

<p>“That night Winnie came to see me, and she
smiled at me as though to say how pleased she
was.</p>

<p>“The next day Lord Reckavile sent for me
and told me to tell Stevens to get Brown the
constable to come up about the poachers. He
was to be here just before seven o’clock. How
I laughed to myself, I saw his trap. He had
arranged for Mr. Halley to be outside his
window at seven.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cook came in the afternoon and Lord
Reckavile saw him in the hall. I knew why—the
library he intended to keep as it was for his
own vile purpose. He kept it locked all day, but
when Mr. Cook had gone I followed him on
tiptoe, and when I found he had forgotten to turn
the key I knew he was delivered into my hands,
and that the time had come. I carried my knife
ready, I had kept it always sharp for such an
occasion.</p>

<p>“I opened the door very slowly and carefully,
and peeped in, and nearly spoilt everything by
crying out, for the first words I heard were those
of Mr. Halley and himself on the previous day.
Of course, I guessed he was using his dictaphone.
He never would have a secretary or typist in the
house, and used to send his records away to
London or somewhere to be written out. I don’t
think he ever wrote a line at all with his pen
except to sign cheques.</p>

<p>“I saw his horrible plan at once. He could
turn this record on and slip out of the window.
Then Mr. Halley would be found in the room
with all the marks of a struggle. How I
chuckled! Yes, Mr. Halley would fall into the
trap all right, but not such as had been devised.</p>

<p>“He was bending over the dictaphone and
laughing a fiendish laugh, when I stole up to
him. He had taken his coat off, and was in his
shirt sleeves, when I drove the knife home,
wearing a glove to prevent any finger prints showing
and shouting out that Winnie was revenged at
last, I could see her looking at me and nodding
her head to show how grateful she was.</p>

<p>“He gave one horrible gasping cry, and I
caught him as he fell, and threw the body on the
sofa. I put his coat on, as I thought it would
look more natural. I had just finished when I
heard a knock and knew it was Brown.</p>

<p>“I waited sufficient time, as I thought for Mr.
Halley to be outside, then went to the door and
turned on the Dictaphone, and came back for
Brown—but in my excitement I made one fatal
mistake, I forgot to open the French window. I
could have kicked myself, but it was too late.</p>

<p>“While Brown was examining the body I
whipped off the record and hid it. That was all.
I waited each day, hoping Mr. Halley would be
arrested, and then I hoped to get a chance of
killing him. If I had known that it was he who
was sitting in that chair he would have been a
dead man. But I am glad now. After hearing
his story I felt he too had suffered, and I should
have been content with my revenge. It was only
when you accused Mr. Cook, and I thought an
innocent man might suffer for my crime that I
determined to tell the whole truth. I am an old
man and shall not live long now in any case.”</p>

<p>He ceased and Sinclair took the statement
from Fletcher, who had written it down.</p>

<p>“Sign this statement,” he said “if you are
satisfied with it.”</p>

<p>The old man read it through carefully, and
signed it with a firm hand.</p>

<p>“Now Giles—or Mr. Wheatland—if you wish
to make an act of reparation—it lies in your
power. Do you know where the marriage
certificate is hidden?”</p>

<p>“Why of course. My wife told me when she
was dying. I never touched it as I felt it was
a magnet which would bring the other Reckavile
home some day.”</p>

<p>He rose and went to the old desk. Brown
carefully walking beside him. Stooping down
he touched a secret spring, and a drawer,
carefully hidden in the carving at the back, sprang
open. Giles drew out a faded package and a
record, and placed them on the table.</p>

<p>Sinclair opened the packet and handed the
contents to Halley who turned white with relief.</p>

<p>“At last,” he said taking out the faded
document, which meant so much to him. Without a
word he handed it to Ena. It was much faded,
and had been soaked with sea water, but was still
readable.</p>

<p>Sinclair rose and put the record on the
Dictaphone which he wound up and started. Of all
the gruesome things that this room had witnessed
this was the strangest. The now familiar words
of the quarrel were repeated between the dead
and the living.</p>

<p>Brown was shaking as though he had seen a
ghost, and the others were strangely moved.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut it off, for Heaven’s sake,” said
Sefton, and at the moment with the final shriek it
ceased with a click.</p>

<p>All eyes had been rivetted on the instrument,
when Sinclair rose with a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>“Stop him,” he shouted, pointing a finger at
Giles.</p>

<p>Brown and Andrews seized the old man, who
made no resistance, but smiled at them.</p>

<p>“No, you fools, he’s taken poison,” and
Sinclair rushed round the table, and forced open the
grim jaws, but it was too late, and with a heavy
groan the old man collapsed. Sefton sprang to
Sinclair’s side and ripped open Giles’ waistcoat.
A moment’s examination was sufficient.</p>

<p>“He’s dead,” he said solemnly, “it must have
been a terribly rapid poison.”</p>

<p>Ena had burst into tears, the strain had been
too great, and Halley rose and went to her side.</p>

<p>“Fool that I was,” said Sinclair. “I might
have guessed. This was what was contained in
that little leather case we found. Reckavile must
have carried it about with him for such a crisis
as he knew might occur. You know suicide is in
the family,” he added in a low voice so that
Halley should not hear. “I have seen something
like that in India. It was probably some deadly
alkaloid. Giles must have got hold of it from
Reckavile, and kept it for such a contingency.
Still,” he said musingly “perhaps it is for the
best. The old man had become a monomaniac
brooding over his revenge, and it would have
been dreadful to have sent him to the gallows.”</p>

<p>Brown and Andrews carried the body, already
stiffening, into the bedroom, and covered it with
a sheet.</p>

<p>The rest rose to their feet.</p>

<p>“You will make a full report on this,
Andrews,” said Sinclair when the officer returned,
“and I will report in London. There is no
particular object in making more of a sensation than
we are obliged, but the whole thing will have to
come out when Lord Reckavile here makes his
claim to the title.”</p>

<p>“I will go back to London, sir,” said Fletcher,
and his face was white. “I seem to have made a
pretty mess of things all round.”</p>

<p>Sinclair laid a kindly hand on his shoulder.
“Don’t take this too much to heart, my boy, we
all have to learn, and you are young yet. Only
I think you owe an apology to Lord Reckavile.”</p>

<p>Fletcher looked with gratitude at his Chief.</p>

<p>“I owe an apology all round, and I tender it
now,” he said.</p>

<p>He shook hands with each, and when he came
to Ena, he smiled sadly, “I wish you both the
greatest happiness.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch213">

<h2>Chapter XIII. <br> The Last</h2>

<p>The sun was sparkling on the sea, and all
nature was rejoicing as though pleased
that the black shadow had been lifted at last.</p>

<p>Southgate and his wife were setting luncheon
in the old timbered room at the <i>Black Horse</i>,
with great care. There were flowers on the table,
and a row of bottles on the sideboard.</p>

<p>“That will do I think,” he said, standing back
to admire his work. A sound of voices outside
announced the coming of the guests, and the
Southgates melted away to smarten up.</p>

<p>Ena and her brother came in with Lord
Reckavile and she looked a pretty sight in the sunlit
room, a picture of happiness, now that the clouds
had gone. In Reckavile also there was a subtle
change. He appeared younger and the sad look
had given place to a merry twinkle of the eye.
He walked more briskly, and with a self
assurance unknown before.</p>

<p>Sefton was thoroughly contented. There was
a very good prospect of being able to go back to
the Hospital to qualify, and his experience had
taught him that his father’s discovery was no idle
dream. They took their seats and waited for
Sinclair who was due to complete the party.</p>

<p>Reckavile rang the bell, and Southgate
appeared.</p>

<p>“Have you no servants?” asked Reckavile in
mock anger.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—I mean, my lord,” stammered the
landlord.</p>

<p>“ ‘Sir’ will do Southgate, for the
present—why do you not do as I asked you?”</p>

<p>“What was that, sir?”</p>

<p>“Lay two places more for yourself and Mrs.
Southgate.”</p>

<p>“Oh sir! We couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, either you lunch with us, or we
don’t have any meal at all.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said the gratified man “I
will tell the missus.”</p>

<p>A car drove up to the door, and Sinclair came
in.</p>

<p>“I hope I’m not late,” he said shaking hands.</p>

<p>“Not a bit, you’re just in time,” said
Reckavile.</p>

<p>Soon they were gathered round the table, as
merry a party as one could wish to see.</p>

<p>“How are things going, Lord Reckavile?”
asked Sinclair, when Southgate had uncorked the
bottles.</p>

<p>“It will take some time to get these matters
settled, as the whole question will have to come
before the House of Lords, but my lawyers think
there will be no real difficulty, and have been
very good in covering my temporary needs.
Now tell us all about the case, as you promised
to do, you know we all want to know how you
managed to solve the problem.”</p>

<p>“There is no magic about it,” said Sinclair
modestly. “You see from the very first I saw
clearly that, as we do not live in the age of
witches and magic, there was only one man who
could have had access to Reckavile, and that was
old Giles, however much the problem was
surrounded with difficulties. When I got Fletcher’s
report, I saw the whole thing. Don’t misunderstand
me. It is a matter of experience, not of
cleverness. Fletcher had all the clues in front
of him. The mention of a Dictaphone told me
all I wanted to know. I had given him a broad
hint when I told him the history of the
Reckaviles, and I will admit that I thought he had
committed suicide, a diabolical suicide to get his
half brother hanged. I am not at all certain
even now that that was not his real intention.
He would have hidden the record, and swallowed
the poison—you saw how quickly it worked—and
things would have looked very bad for you,
Lord Reckavile.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said the latter. “I saw something
in his eyes at the last interview which made me
suspicious of such a plot.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Sinclair continued “my mind being
set on Giles, I pursued the usual practice, for
which I take no credit, in hunting up his
antecedents, and traced him as Wheatland. Then
the whole thing was clear as daylight, but there
was not a shadow of real evidence.”</p>

<p>“You remember,” said Reckavile, taking up
the tale, “Southgate came to your bungalow,
Ena, with important news that Sunday morning.
The police had been down there making
enquiries about me, and things were getting warm,
so I thought the wisest course was to go to
London and see Sinclair, and tell him the whole
story. That was why he came down, but of
course I knew nothing of his suspicions.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Sefton “that was why you
disguised yourself the second time.”</p>

<p>“It was my suggestion,” said Sinclair “if my
theory was correct I saw that he was in very
great danger from Giles, and the only way was
to keep up the disguise till we had forced a
confession from him, or got hold of such evidence
that we could obtain an arrest. The record,
which I was certain had not been destroyed, as
Giles had no chance of doing so, and the
certificate, were the things we were after, and I was so
convinced that they were in the desk that we
were prepared to break it to pieces if necessary,
but Fletcher interfered, and afterwards Giles
saved us the trouble. That I think explains the
whole thing. I can only say how thankful we
ought to be to have come out without another
tragedy. But come, let’s talk of something more
pleasant.”</p>

<p>Southgate rose at a signal from Sinclair, and
filled their glasses with a very extra special
champagne.</p>

<p>Sinclair rose. “To the health of the future
Lord and Lady Reckavile,” he said.</p>

<p>The toast was drunk with enthusiasm.
Sinclair set his glass down with deliberation, and
said musingly “Good stuff that. I wonder how
much it paid towards the revenue,” and he
grinned broadly at Southgate who looked
sheepish.</p>

<p>“Come along,” he said with a wink to Sefton
“let’s examine Southgate’s cellars,” and with a
laugh they went out, leaving Reckavile and Ena
alone.</p>

<p>“We will go to Italy, dear,” he said taking
her hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, I want to see your mother’s grave, and
the little cottage where you were born. How
happy she would be if she knew everything had
come right,” and her eyes were wet.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she does. If you will take me as I
am, we will get married, and get away from this
place with its evil memories.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. lord,” she said, making him a
curtsey “but don’t forget it was here you met
me, is that one of the evil memories?”</p>

<p>“That is the happiest memory I have ever
had,” he made answer, catching her to him. “I
came here in winter, and now spring has come,
and soon it will be summer. When another
winter comes it will find us together. The Curse has
died out in one fiendish act of evil, and revenge,
but by God’s grace we will establish a new line
with nobler thoughts.”</p>

<p>He kissed her then, and she hid her blushes in
his passionate embrace.</p>
